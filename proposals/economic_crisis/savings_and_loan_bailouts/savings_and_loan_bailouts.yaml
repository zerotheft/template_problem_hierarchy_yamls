# The following summary is not an exact amount, but an opinion on an approximation
# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

#I need you to find the PARTs of the $500 billion total amount. Find sources that break that into at least 3 parts. I think one part is $160 billion. Where does the last $340 billion come from. one source said $200 billion was "interest"

# I could find the estimated direct cost and indirect cost together with the interest amount. But, the total amount was not $500 billion. Please go to line 235 and 261 for the data.

  "It is high time that Congress declares savings and loan crooks public enemy No. 1", statement of Sen. John Heinz, R, PA. S&L Bailout is the Savings and Loan bailouts that happened around 1989. Capitalism without the theft means BAILOUTs do not have to happen.  This gives the massive size of the damage.
  BAILOUTS of Savings & Loan Crisis: $500,000,000,000
  COST TO RUN the USA GOV: 304,000,000,000 (in 1989)

  It cost MORE to bail out this massive problem than to run the ENTIRE US government:
  a) All US Federal worker salaries
  b) All Federal government programs
  c) The Military & intelligence services
  d) Social programs & welfare
  e) Paying interest on the US national debt

  The Savings and Loan Crisis was the most significant bank collapse since the Great Depression of 1929 when it happened. By 1989, more than 1,000 of the nation's savings and loans had failed.

  The crisis cost $160,000,000,000. Taxpayers paid $132,000,000,000, and the S&L industry paid the rest. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation paid $20,000,000,000 to depositors of failed S&Ls before it went bankrupt. More than 500 S&Ls were insured by state-run funds. Their failures cost $185,000,000 before they collapsed. 

  The crisis ended what had once been a secure source of home mortgages. It also destroyed the idea of state-run bank insurance funds.  

  So, the question arise what caused this failures? Was there some fraud / scandal that triggered the crisis?  source: https://www.thebalance.com/savings-and-loans-crisis-causes-cost-3306035.

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how the economy is being rigged against citizens. {~C~}

reasoning: |
  "THE BOOK" is "The Best way to Rob a Bank is to Own One" by William K. Black
  1) What is the total bailout amount on S&L Crisis? Who paid the bailout amount?
  2) What caused the savings and loan institution failures?
  3) Did hundreds or thousands of people get convicted by the DoJ because of the Savings & Loan crisis? "A more aggressive response followed the savings and loan crisis of the ’80s and early ’90s, when more than 1,000 bankers were convicted by the Justice Department."
    source: "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/were-bankers-jailed-in-past-financial-crises/#:~:text=Savings%20%26%20Loan%20Crisis,convicted%20by%20the%20Justice%20Department.
  4) Did Citizens need to bail out the Savings & Loan crisis?
  5) Did citizens have to pay for an S&L Bailout? (This includes with Federal Reserve money printing)
  6) Was there economic damage of any kind?  Did this come from unethical sources?
  7) Did THE BOOK claim S&L banks create blow-up commercial loans?
  8) Did THE BOOK claim S&L banks create blow-up commercial loans?  And were Asset Appraisal Firms used in an unethical way to generate wrong valuations?  Did was this done in an unethical way?  Did it cause financial damage to victims (like the US tax payers?)
  9) Did THE BOOK claim the US Congress sub-committee on Savings & Loans sell out the American people by allowing this to happen?
      Was what congress did unethical? Did congress heavily contribute to allowing this problem to get far bigger by not stopping it early?   
  10) Did THE BOOK claim that congress's S&L Subcommittee were warned when the problem was far smaller years earlier?  Did THE BOOK claim the congressional S&L subcommittee chose to not fix the problem?  Did THE BOOK claim the damage would have been a fraction of the damage if it was stopped earlier?
  11) Did THE BOOK claim any of these:  The Federal level of investigators of the S&L problems (like NCFIRRE) get stopped?  
    Was congress's S&L subcommittee responsible in this damage to the investigating firm?  Did they have their management team changed?  Did changing the management team stop the investigation or making in uneffective at stopping the problem early?
    Do you consider any changes/damage to the Federal investigators of the S&L problems cause financial damages to US Tax payers? (Such as not allowing the problem to) wrong valuations? Did was this done in an unethical way?  Did it cause financial damage to victims (like the US tax payers?)      
  12) Did THE BOOK claim the following: S&L banks create blow-up commercial loans? And Appraisal Firms used in an unethical way to generate wrong valuations?  Did was this done in an unethical way?  Did it cause financial damage to victims (like the US tax payers?)
  13) Did THE BOOK claim that the problem was mostly in S&Ls in Texas?  Then unethical behavior happened to allow the companies to move their companies and problems to California, in order to stop Texas investigations into the problem?  Did this unethical cause damage to be far bigger due to unethical behavior by Congress and/or local governments?
  14) Did THE BOOK claim that the problem was THEN mostly in S&Ls in California?  Then unethical behavior happened to allow the companies to move their companies and problems OUT OF California, in order to stop Texas investigations into the problem?  Did this unethical cause damage to be far bigger due to unethical behavior by Congress and/or local governments?
  15) Where 5 congressmen on the S&L Congressional Subcommittee end up being widely called The "Keating Five"?
      Did claims occur that they had unethically caused the problem to not be fixed? Did it cause rigged economy theft to US tax payers?

      The cost of the S&l bailout over the next decade will be almost $500 billion, or about $2,000 for every man,woman and child in the country.

      This cost includes about $217 billion in interest payments- because the federal government is financing the bailout through on-budget and off-budget borrowing instead of meeting the cost out of current revenue.

      CALL IT the Case of the Missing Megabillions. We all know by now that taxpayers will have to fork over a sultan's ransom to make good the losses of America's insolvent S&Ls -- $140 billion to $180 billion, according to the latest government estimates, and well over $500 billion, if you add on interest expense and the extra costs a recession might bring.

      Tracking $147 billion... ... and how it grows -- Consultant Bert Ely calculates the government could resolve the S&L mess tomorrow by writing a check for $147 billion. Financing that sum over 40 years at 8.5%, however, adds $500 billion in interest and lifts the total to $647 billion. For a fair comparison with other government expenses, most experts say to ignore interest.

The estimated cost to taxpayers, not counting the interest payments on government bonds sold to finance the industry's bailout, is $150 to $175 billion. If interest over the next thirty years is added to this tab, the cost approaches $500 billion. 

      The ravaged state of the savings and loan industry and the insolvency of the FSLIC finally forced the government to take legislative steps to reregulate thrifts and to end their financial hemorrhaging. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was the Bush administration's bailout plan. It was approved by Congress within six months and went into effect in August 1989. The bill raised $50 billion over three years through the sale of bonds to be paid back over forty years. This money was to be used largely to finance the federal seizure of hundreds of insolvent savings and loans and to provide funds to cover insured deposits. Since it was financed by bonds, more than half of the final bailout cost will consist of interest payments. In July 1996 the General Accounting Office predicted the total tab would be close to $500 billion.

      There are several ways in which the Bush family plays into the Savings and Loan scandal, which involves not only many members of the Bush family but also many other politicians that are still in office and still part of the Bush Jr. administration today.  Jeb Bush, George Bush Sr., and his son Neil Bush have all been implicated in the Savings and Loan Scandal, which cost American tax payers over $1.4 TRILLION dollars (note that this is about one quarter of our national debt).

      A broad range of scholars and market participants have concluded that the erosion of trust caused by the ongoing wave of control fraud significantly influenced millions of investors to withdraw from the stock market, which caused a staggering loss of market capitalization (Stiglitz 2003, 274). That loss was $9 trillion, so if the consensus is correct that the erosion of trust contributed materially to that loss at its peak, the indirect losses from control fraud were crushing.

      Years later, the extraordinary cost of the 1980s S&L crisis still astounds many taxpayers, depositors, and policymakers. The cost of bailing out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured the deposits in failed S&Ls, may eventually exceed $160 billion. At the end of 2004, the direct cost of the S&L crisis to taxpayers was $124 billion , according to financial statements published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the successor to the FSLIC. Additionally, healthy S&Ls as well as commercial banks have been taxed approximately another $30 billion to pay for S&L cleanup costs. Finally, the federal courts are still resolving the so-called goodwill cases stemming from regulatorily inspired mergers of failing S&Ls into healthy S&Ls in the early 1980s (discussed below). Resolving these cases will probably cost taxpayers another $5–$10 billion.

      The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s included the failure of 747 savings and loans (also known as thrifts). The ultimate cost of the crisis has been estimated to have totaled around $160.1 billion , about $124.6 billion of which was directly paid for by the federal government via a financial bailout under the leadership of President George H.W. Bush—that is, the American taxpayer provided the funding for the bailout, either directly or through charges on their savings and loan accounts and increased taxes—which contributed to the large budget deficits of the early 1990s.

      The thrift crisis caused a sustained loss in gross national product. The cumulative loss between 1981 and 1990 in 1990 dollars in this simulation is about $200 billion. By the year 2000, the total cumulative loss in forgone GNP is almost $500 billion (in 1990 dollars). The peak annual loss of GNP is about 0.7 percent of the baseline level in 1992--or about $42 billion in 1990 dollars.

      However, little of the forgone production can be attributed to the federal financing of the taxpayers' cost of the S&L failures, as most of the cost stems from the initial losses in productive capital. The cumulative loss in GNP in 1990 dollars for the years 1981 through 1990 could be as large as a whopping $200 billion. An additional loss approaching $300 billion of forgone GNP is likely to occur during the years 1991 through 2000 as a con- sequence of the S&L breakdown.

      The largest accounting abuse came from GAAP’s failure to recognize market-value losses caused by interest rate changes. GAAP did not recognize the $150 billion loss in market value caused by interest rate increases.

      The most common fraud mechanism was to have Hermann K. Beebe fund the purchase of an S&L. Beebe was a control fraud, a convicted felon running a Louisiana insurance company. He was an associate of the New Orleans mob. Beebe helped scores of control frauds acquire S&Ls and banks in the Southwest (Mayer 1990, 226). Beebe would loan the money to buy the S&L. The buyer would, in turn, cause his S&L to make far larger loans to Beebe’s straws. The straws, of course, would not repay the loans. Beebe won, the S&L owner won, and the taxpayers lost.

      The market share of S&Ls for single family mortgage loans went from 53% in 1975 to 30% in 1990. U.S. General Accounting Office estimated cost of the crisis to around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly paid for by the U.S. government from 1986 to 1996. That figure does not include thrift insurance funds used before 1986 or after 1996. It also does not include state run thrift insurance funds or state bailouts. 

      The federal government ultimately appropriated $105 billion to resolve the crisis. After banks repaid loans through various procedures, there was an estimated net loss to taxpayers of somewhere between ($123.8–132.1) 124 and 132 billion dollars by the end of 1999.

      Here’s how it works with appraisers. The appraisal fee is larger for commercial real estate than for residential, and it is greater in absolute size for more expensive than for less expensive properties. As a result, both appraisers and S&L control frauds gained if the S&L did more commercial real estate lending on more expensive projects. The S&L loan officer calls the appraiser and asks him for a favor. The loan officer has to make a recommendation on a proposed $60 million loan in two weeks. Could the appraiser please give him a preliminary, oral estimate of value as soon as possible, before completing the written appraisal report? (Note that the loan officer has communicated the size of the loan to the appraiser.) The S&L can’t make the loan without violating Bank Board rules if the appraiser does not come back with a value of at least $60 million. The appraiser calls with preliminary estimate of value. If it is at least $60 million, the loan officer tells him to finalize the written appraisal, pays his full fee, and uses him in the future. If he comes back under $60 million the loan officer thanks him effusively, says that there is no need to complete the written appraisal given the inadequate value of the property, pays a reduced fee, and the S&L never uses the appraiser again. Functionally paying an appraiser a fee to value property (that is, say, really worth $35 million) at over $60 million is equivalent to a bribe. But it is a “perfect crime,” impossible to prosecute. Control frauds know that they only need a tiny group of appraisers to inflate property values; there is no need to suborn the entire profession. The thing that most people don’t understand is that this whole process can (and typically was) done in a way that a transcript of the conversation could appear on the front page of the local newspaper without embarrassing the appraiser or the loan officer. Shopping for an accommodating auditor involves a similar process. The dynamics differ because control frauds virtually always use top-tier audit firms, whereas appraisers are often sole proprietors. Institutions matter a great deal, and control frauds are adept at finding the weak link in any institutional chain.

      In a March 1988 report to Congres, the FLHBB cited fraud and insider abuse as the most pernicious of all factors leading to thrift insolvency. Collusion by management with borrowers and appraisers often concealed losses and liabilities. In certain criminal cases currently in the courts, management is alleged to have falsified delinquent loan and thrift records and misappropriated assets for their own use and benefit. The extent of fraudulent activities was so far-reaching that Congress passed a $65 million increase in the Department of Justice's budget to investigate and prosecute crimes against thrifts, as well as imposing stiff civil penalties. Rep. Carroll Hubbard (KY) aptly noted that in many cases independent auditors of S&Ls were "victims" because they received false and misleading information from the institutions they audited.

      Congress wanted a cover-up.

      Daniel Fischel (1995, 211) says that the second stage of the debacle was “completely predictable.” A cover-up works by grossly inflating net worth and net income, but to close an S&L the regulator often needs to show insolvency. This can make it very hard to close control frauds prior to their failing catastrophically (e.g., losses exceeding 30 percent of liabilities).

      Pratt never identified and put out of business a control fraud and never identified the wave of control frauds entering the industry. He praised them as entrepreneurs. Pratt disdained traditional S&L CEOs and considered them the problem. The control frauds had dug in for two years before Gray began to fight back.

      The current wave of control fraud has done great systemic damage. It need not have happened, had we learned the appropriate lessons from the S&L debacle. 

      Ed Gray emerged as the most unlikely of heroes. President Reagan made him Bank Board chairman because he supported greater deregulation. Within four months, however, Gray began his transformation into the great reregulator and became the bane of the S&L control frauds and their allies. 

      The industry will lobby regulators, the administration, and Congress to aid the cover-up by endorsing accounting abuses and minimizing takeovers of insolvents.

      Regan testified that while Gray warned of the coming crisis, he, Regan, ignored the warning. Not only did President Reagan never request a briefing from Gray about the debacle, but they never discussed it personally after Reagan appointed Gray.

      Ed Kane developed a famous analogy to sum up his view of the S&L debacle. He said tha t the Bank Board’s distorted accounting left the agency like the driver of a car with a muddy windshield (Kane 1989, 167–169).

      Some critics claim that Pratt expressly encouraged S&Ls to grow out of their problems. Pratt was generally careful to avoid going that far. Nevertheless, he gave the industry the ability to grow massively, and he took no action to stop the large number of S&Ls that began to grow rapidly. The results were, predictably, disastrous.

      S&L control frauds consistently showed the ability to deceive uninsured private creditors and shareholders. Elliot Levitas, one of the commissioners appointed to investigate the causes of the debacle as part of the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement (NCFIRRE), emphasized this point in 1993, but no economist took him seriously. The current wave of control frauds has proved his point conclusively.

      Bank Board virtually never made criminal referrals when it found fraud, and the Justice Department rarely prosecuted. The Bank Board had no formal criminal referral system.

      The Reagan administration decides to cover up the S&L crisis in 1981.

      Congress supported the cover-up because the alternative was to cut popular social programs. The cover-up optimized the industry for control fraud in several ways. The most direct contribution was abusive accounting

      The largest accounting abuse came from GAAP’s failure to recognize market-value losses caused by interest rate changes. GAAP did not recognize the $150 billion loss in market value caused by interest rate increases.

      Every $1 million of fictitious capital allowed the control fraud to grow by up to $1 billion and increased the risk to the taxpayers by the same amount.

      Texas had more control frauds than any other state. 

      There were over 300 control frauds.  11th District (California, Arizona, and Nevada) had 58 control frauds (Black 1998). 

      Growth was fastest in the states with the greatest deregulation and the weakest state supervision (White 1991, 100). Forty Texas S&Ls grew by more than 300 percent between 1982 and 1985. The percentage of assets best suited to creating fictitious accounting income increased dramatically at the high fliers between 1982 and 1985.

      Wright’s actions on behalf of the control frauds had enormous direct consequences, they were decisive in forcing him to resign in disgrace from the House, and because they delayed the closure of dozens of (mostly Texas) control frauds, they led to billions of dollars in additional costs to the taxpayers. The indirect consequences were even greater.

      The clumsy interventions of members of Congress on behalf of the frauds obscured the Reagan-Bush administration’s contributions to the control frauds’ success and the creation of the debacle. Wright’s actions proved critical in causing Gray’s successor to appease Charles Keating. That, in turn, led to the worst failure of a financial institution in U.S. history, to the S&L debacle becoming a political scandal, to the resignation in disgrace of Gray’s successor, to the termination of the Bank Board, and to an ethics investigation of the Keating Five by a reluctant Senate. The Speaker’s intervention was a “hinge event” that changed a wide range of policies.

      Wright believed Hall’s experts’ claim that his bankruptcy would “destroy twenty-nine S&Ls” (Barry 1989, 218). In fact, those S&Ls had already failed, and the TDRs locked in that failure. The TDRs, along with Wright’s actions blocking the FSLIC recap, delayed the takeover of the twenty-nine failed S&Ls and greatly increased losses to the taxpayers and the harm to Texas’s economy.

      Texas had over 100. Together, California and Texas had over half of the control frauds and produced over half the total losses.

      The national recession of the early 1990s and the cut in defense spending made possible by the fall of the Soviet Union caused California real estate values to drop. One of the important reasons that the California real estate recession was far less severe than that in Texas is that the California control frauds were closed or brought under control well before the recession hit. As Chapter 4 explains, control frauds followed the same practices in California and Texas and failed for the same reasons, even when they were lending to a vibrant real estate market.

      Current scandals have generated many other indirect economic costs; lost jobs and pensions again predominate. Enron and its fellow conspirators (virtually every major energy trader in America and several electrical generators) caused blackouts in California, raised the price of electrical power dramatically, and bankrupted California’s electrical utilities. (These control frauds were aimed at customers, not creditors.

      A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf. 

      Keating was hit with a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering action, filed against him by the regulators. In talking to reporters in April, Keating said, "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so."

      In the wake of the Lincoln failure, former FHLBB chair Gray went public about all five of the senators' assistance to Keating in a May 21, 1989, front-page story by John Dougherty in the Dayton Daily News, saying that in the April 1987 meetings the senators had sought "to directly subvert the regulatory process" to benefit Keating. Press attention to the senators began to pick up, with a July 1989 Los Angeles Times article about Cranston's role. Within a couple of months, Arizona Republic and Washington Post reporters were investigating McCain's personal relationships with Keating.

      Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in 1989, at a cost of $3.4 billion to the federal government (and thus taxpayers). Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many investors lost their life savings.

      The federal government ultimately appropriated $105 billion to resolve the crisis. After banks repaid loans through various procedures, there was an estimated net loss to taxpayers of somewhere between ($123.8–132.1) 124 and 132 billion dollars by the end of 1999.

    description: |
      In 1989, federal regulators finally took control of Lincoln, which by then was insolvent. Its collapse, which required the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to cover more than $3 billion in losses, was the largest of more than 1,000 failures in the savings and loan industry. The savings and loan crisis ultimately bankrupted the FSLIC and cost American taxpayers an estimated $124 billion.
