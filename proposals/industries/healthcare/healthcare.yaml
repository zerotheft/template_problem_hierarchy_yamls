# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

describe_problem_area:
  Healthcare is an essential and life saving solutions for many who need it but the question is whether the system is fully transparent and whether it is in favour of the common people.

  Rigged theft can be measured top-down by comparing how much the U.S. spends on medical compared to similar countries (where labor costs are close to ours).

  The US per-capita cost of healthcare may be 200%* that of Canada / Australia / UK (*Research and update 200%). Per-capital healthcare cost combines socialized spending and non-socialized spending, so this isn't a discussion on socializing spending or not.
  Free markets involve intense competition to maximize quality and minimize prices for citizens.
  Assume advanced technology could compel the medical industry to have-
  1) Strong competition between companies to minimize prices while maximizing quality
  2) Complete transparency with the products and services offered
  3) Consumers able to conveniently access to all pricing information

  Congress is the part of the government that must protect citizens from being robbed by crony corporations.
  Healthcare lobbyists spend incredible amounts to influence, and potentially corrupt, members of Congress.
  This is to compare HOW MUCH MONEY are we being ripped off compared to if congress made sure advanced technology allowed US citizens to get low cost and high-quality medical services by the medical industry having extreme- a) transparency, b) historic prices & quality ratings, c) competition, d) easy for customers to go to competitors based on the best price/value.

  If you VOTE YES that there is theft by rigged economy, you are saying that citizens pay TOO high medical costs (on a per citizen way) because economics is rigged or broken in healthcare because some or all :-a) no transparent pricing, b) prices given AFTER service delivered, c) no ability to price shop, d) reduced competition to keep prices down.

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how the economy is being rigged against citizens. {~C~}
# {~C~} These are just examples and ideas to get you started.  You should delete them and build your own arguments. {~C~}
reasoning:
  1) Are prices for the same medical services much higher in the U.S. than in other countries where labor costs are similar? Does that raise concerns that U.S.healthcare prices are rigged?
  2) Rigged theft can also be measured top-down by comparing how much the USA spends on medical compared to similar countries (where labor costs are close to ours)
  3) Show examples where medical charges are observed.
  4) Are experts saying that medical costs are out of control?
  5) When Obamacare passed, did 'cost controls' get removed?
  6) Does congress give citizens the technology tools for transparency in the medical industry? Transparency on prices? On quality?
  7) Does congress give citizens the technology tools to see PRICES before they have medical procedures, so high amounts of competition occur?
  8) Does congress give citizens the technology tools that make extreme pricing competition happen when people need medical insurance in an emergency or are incapacitated?
  9) Does congress give citizens the technology tools for transparency on that medical provider's prices compared to others?  So, citizens can select medical clinics based on the best overall prices?
  10) When citizens have to pay for medical costs without insurance, are they charged unethically large amou\nts compared to what insurance pays?
  11) Ethically must congress investigate and/or fix when costs are out-of-control in medical. Does congress? Do they publicly provide documents of where very bad out-of-control costs are happening?

# {~C~} The following are questions and suggestions you may want to use in building an estimate of the "size" of the problem. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how much is being ripped off through rigging of the economy. {~C~}

      The International Federation of Health Plans Comparative Price Report details healthcare products and services around the world. Its most recent survey, from 2015, looked at seven countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Spain. Results showed that not only were U.S. healthcare costs higher compared to the other countries in the survey, but there was also a significant difference in what people pay in the U.S. for the same drug or medical procedure.

      Tom Sackville, chief executive of the IFHP, said many people believe, incorrectly, that Americans spend more time in a hospital and more time visiting the doctor or having procedures, which is what drives up prices. "That's not the case. It appears it's quite an efficient system—they don't overuse it," Sackville said. "But each time they have an item, an episode of care, it costs two or three or five times more than it should, by international standards."
      When comparing procedures across the seven countries, the Federation ensured that the entire process was "like-for-like, across international boundaries," Sackville said. For example, when comparing the price for a standard MRI scan, the data came from procedures where identical types of machines were used with equal staffing resources per procedure.

      For example, the average cost in the U.S. for an MRI scan was $1,119, compared to $811 in New Zealand, $215 in Australia and $181 in Spain. However, data showed that the 95th percentile in the price of this procedure in the U.S. was $3,031, meaning some people are paying nearly $3,000 more for a standard MRI scan in the U.S. than the average person in Australia and Spain.
      Or take a standard hip replacement procedure. The average cost in the U.S. is $29,067, which is $10,000 more than the next highest-cost country, Australia. However, the data show that the 95th percentile cost in the U.S. reaches $57,225, $50,000 more than the average price in South Africa and $42,000 more than in New Zealand.

The second-highest ranking country, Switzerland, spent 12.2 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, New Zealand and Australia devote only 9.3 percent, approximately half as much as the U.S. does. The share of the economy spent on health care has been steadily increasing since the 1980s for all countries because health spending growth has outpaced economic growth, in part because of advances in medical technologies, rising prices in the health sector, and increased demand for services.

      Last summer, I had one of those ”$400 emergencies,” except in my case it could have been a four-figure emergency, and a potentially life-threatening one to boot. A primary care physician found a lump and sent me to a specialist, who sent me to a cancer specialist, who thought I might have a tumor. “You need an MRI,” he told me.
      Even with a family health insurance plan for which we pay a steep premium each month, we know we’re only partially protected. That’s because, like , we have an even steeper annual deductible to cover before coverage kicks in, plus coinsurance and copays.
      The hospital where I was sent to get my MRI could charge $2,000 or even $3,000 for the scan. I had no way to know. The average cost in the U.S. is $1,119, according to a 2014 survey by the International Federation of Health Plans, and everything in New York City is notoriously expensive. (By contrast, the scan costs only $130, on average, in Spain and $215 in Australia.)
      No one said anything to me about price when scheduling the scan.But the problem is not just that healthcare is expensive in America. As Sarah Kliff reports for Vox, the prices are also secret.
      It took persistence and several calls back and forth to the hospital, the doctor’s office and my insurance company, but I finally found out that the hospital I was initially referred to would charge about $1,000, of which I would be responsible for $859.50.
      I promptly canceled my appointment and spent an afternoon polling other providers, and double-checking with my insurance company, until I found two more affordable options: a stand-up MRI place in my neighborhood, where the cost to me would be $505, and a store-front operation in midtown Manhattan where the cost to me would be $450.

      My doctor at Tulane University Medical Center had suggested an abdominal MRI as part of a portfolio of check-ups to better understand the possible trajectory of a hereditary condition that might affect me.
      I’m 27 years old, and wanted to know more, and so I said sure, let’s do it.
      About a month later, on the day before my procedure would take place, I got a call from Tulane asking how I planned to pay for my MRI the following morning.
      “How much is it?” I asked.
      “Well, your deductible is $5,000,” I was told.
      “Yes, but how much is the procedure,” I asked again.
      “Your deductible is $5,000, ma’am,” came the response.
      We played this merry-go-round game of call and response for about 10 minutes before the caller gave up, saying she’d call later with the cost of the procedureI’d otherwise be undergoing just 18 hours later. She finally did: I would be asked to pay $4,458 for an abdominal MRI without contrast, which really should have been higher, but I’d already met a couple hundred worth of my deductible.
      Thanks to reporting by Jed Lipinksi at NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, Lee Zurik at WVUE Fox 8 in New Orleans and their use of the tools provided by ClearHealthCosts, I checked the prices of similar MRIs in my area. The price discrepancy was so great — I was quoted a number about 10 times higher than the average I was seeing on ClearHealthCosts’ app — I was sure I was using it incorrectly.
      To test my theory, I requested the CPT and diagnostic codes my doctor listed at Tulane and called Doctors Imaging in Metairie, one of the services listed on the application.
      I was wrong: Tulane was just that much more expensive.
      I ended up canceling the appointment the following morning and made one for a week later at Doctors Imaging. In the end, I paid $672.68 for the exact same service for which Tulane wanted to charge me $4,458.

      Henri and his dad went to the closest emergency department, where the doctors discovered Adam had suffered a minor heart attack. The doctors stabilized him with medication and he spent a night in the facility. The next morning the doctors recommended a heart bypass operation—electively, that is, sometime in the coming weeks. Before Adam got discharged, a hospital representative came to his bedside to talk finances. He explained that the operation would cost $150,000.
      Henri and his parents had no way to know whether this was a fair price. They called a family friend who put them in touch with a good heart surgeon in France. Over the phone, the French surgeon explained that the quality of the operation would be the same in France as it would be in the United States. The family timidly asked how much the operation would cost in France. “About 15,000 U.S. dollars,” said the French surgeon.
      Soon after, the local hospital representative who provided the $150,000 quote visited Henri’s dad again to ask about their plans. “Quite honestly, we are thinking of having the surgery in France for $15,000,” Adam said. Without hesitation, the hospital representative dropped the price to $50,000. Alarmed at the sudden discount, Adam politely declined the offer and booked his flight to France. But as he walked out of the facility, the hospital representative approached him in the hallway one last time. Desperate to close the deal, the hospital official made a final offer: “Okay, we’ll do it for $25,000.”

And for those hospitals that did, the average price was $151,271, just north of what Henri’s dad was quoted. The range of prices was astounding, from $44,000 to $448,000. Did they use gold-plated surgical instruments? No. Was the center that charged ten times more the 
      one with the best outcomes? Nope. Heart surgery outcomes are publicly available. The research showed no correlation between surgery price and quality.

      THE U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM is notorious for its high costs, which Americans traditionally assumed was the price of excellence. In the past two decades, health care has gone from being a source of national pride to one of America’s preeminent concerns.

      Medical services are expensive. There is no getting around it. The average family health insurance premium in the US is approaching $20,000. By one estimate, average family premiums could rise to 100 percent of US median household income by 2033 if trends continue. Meanwhile, growth in medical spending, which has largely been driven by constantly rising prices, is squeezing public and private resources that could be devoted to other priorities. It has caused wage growth for many to stagnate, and it has led to constrained state and local spending for education, infrastructure, and other priorities.

      The Affordable Care Act (ACA), of 2010, or Obamacare, was the most monumental change in US health care policy since the passage of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965. The ACA had 3 primary goals: increasing the number of the insured, improving the quality of care, and reducing the costs of health care. President Obama claimed that the ACA provided significant cost containment, in that costs would have been even much higher if the ACA was not enacted.

      Emanuel's essay correctly notes that Obamacare reduced the ranks of the uninsured, but his claim that it reduced healthcare spending is false. Emanuel concluded that the ACA, which he helped write, "reduced healthcare spending a total of $2.3 trillion" from 2010, the year the ACA was enacted, to 2017. He went on to make an equally astonishing and erroneous claim about health insurance premiums. He alleged they fell by $1,000 per worker, and "about $4,000" for family coverage from 2010 to 2017.
      Healthcare spending as a percent of gross domestic product continued to rise after 2010 at about the same rate it has risen for the last 50 years. Premiums for family coverage for American workers also rose after 2010 at the same rate as before 2010.
      The prestigious Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania (Emanuel's university) found "little evidence that ACA cost containment provisions produced changes necessary to 'bend the cost curve.'"

      Efforts to achieve other policy goals were less successful. The ACA did not stem high and rapidly rising health care costs care for all Americans. Delivery system reforms advanced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center have shown disappointing results, and mechanisms intended to rein in federal costs have been dropped. Despite the promise of affordability, consumers continue to cite medical expenses as their No. one economic concern.

      During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised voters that his health care plan would cut annual premiums by $2,500. That estimate assumed that the plan would produce savings of at least $200 billion a year, or about 8 percent of national health spending projected for 2009.
      National health expenditure (NHE) data show that such savings have not been realized.
      National health spending increased from $2.60 trillion in 2010 to $3.65 trillion in 2018. As a share of the national economy, health spending grew from 17.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 17.7 percent between 2010 and 2018.
      Thus, the ACA did not reduce the level of health care spending.

      Did it slow spending growth? The NHE grew 5.6 percent a year between 2003 and 2010; growth slowed to 4.4 percent a year between 2010 and 2018. However, that comparison ignores the sharp decline in general price inflation following the 2007–09 “Great Recession.” Measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, health care spending grew at an average annual rate of 2.7 percent between 2003 and 2010, and 2.8 percent between 2010 and 2018. 
      A more precise comparison would account for the ongoing slowdown in US population growth. Inflation-adjusted health care spending per capita has accelerated from 1.7 percent a year between 2003 to 2010 to 2.1 percent between 2010 and 2018. 
      Other factors contribute to health care spending growth, including the introduction of new treatments and changes in factors affecting population health. Nonetheless, it is implausible to suggest that the ACA has bent the cost curve down.

      A nationwide analysis of medical bills shows that hospitals typically charge uninsured emergency room patients four times what they’re willing to accept from Medicare for the same service, U.S. researchers say. 
      That’s more than double what those same hospitals charge for services performed in other parts of the hospital, the authors report in JAMA Internal Medicine.
      The new study found, for example, that for a $100 treatment in the emergency room, some hospitals were charging patients up to $1,260.
      Uninsured patients, or people treated outside their insurance company’s preferred network, were charged seven times the Medicare payment to repair a cut, six times more for interpreting an electrocardiogram to check heart function and 5.4 times more to insert an intravenous tube.
      Those prices, they found, could vary widely. An uninsured patient could be expected to pay from 1.6 times more to as much as 27.7 times more to have an emergency read a CT scan of the head.

      Lawmakers are trying to set aside their irreconcilable differences over the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and work to reach bipartisan agreement on a more immediate health care issue, lowering costs for people who already have coverage.
      Returning from their Fourth of July recess, the Senate and House are pushing to end surprise medical bills, curb high prices for medicines, and limit prescription copays for people with Medicare.
      In the Senate, Republican Lamar Alexander has shepherded bipartisan legislation on surprise medical bills through the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that he leads.

      When Wilkes spoke before Congress, Democratic and Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee were working together to craft legislation that would stamp out surprise billing. On the Senate side, members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee were drafting a similar bipartisan solution.
      The subsequent agreement would have fixed the amount doctors could charge for surprise bills, subject to appeal, and required that insurers cover the resulting costs. Within each committee, this approach commanded near-unanimous support.
      The committees announced the deal on December 8. The insurance industry endorsed it. So did consumer advocates. The White House quickly signaled support and pushed for its inclusion in a must-pass December 20 spending package.
      But over the next 48 hours, hospitals and doctors’ groups came out against the proposal. The American Medical Association criticized the agreement. The American Hospital Association wrote that it would “jeopardize patient access to hospital care.” In the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly signaled that he was uncomfortable pushing forward with the fix. Three days after the deal was released, Richard Neal and Kevin Brady, the top Democrat and Republican on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, put out their own surprise billing proposal. It was a classic legislative maneuver designed to derail progress.

      Congress functions as a harmonious well-oiled machine to inflate medical prices. Every politician in the House and Senate is silent as to the actual cause of gigantic insurance premiums, which is rising prices of medical services. Congress turns a blind eye to the pricing of medical services despite the fact that the official U.S. projection confirms national health costs will continue to be driven by the skyrocketing pricing of medical services.

      Lawmakers continue to center around the idea that access to health insurance is the biggest problem, when the issue at hand is the underlying inflation of medical care, not access to health insurance. In other words, they're trying to fix the symptoms without getting to the root cause of the problem. Congress is trying to close a gaping wound with a Band-Aid. It's looking for ways to make health insurance more affordable while ignoring the underlying causes of why health insurance premiums have been rising so quickly in recent decades. Unless Congress shifts its focus and recognizes what the real problem is, healthcare in America isn't going to be fixed, regardless of which plan lawmakers decide on.
