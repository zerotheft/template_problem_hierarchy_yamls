describe_problem_area: |
  Medicare is a U.S. national health insurance program that provides medical insurance primarily for those aged 65 and up. 

  Medicare Part D of Medicare provides prescription drug coverage. Congress passed a law (the non-interference clause) that prohibited Medicare from being able to negotiate drug prices, requiring accepting the price the drug companies offered.

  The question is: has the non-interference clause in Medicare Part D caused excessive spending of taxpayer money and brought extra profits to the pharmaceutical industry?  Has this rigged the economy in favor of the pharmaceutical industry, and resulted in excessive spending of taxpayer money?

  In the ten years between 2007 and 2017, the cost to the US government for just the Part D prescription drug coverage alone was just under $1 trillion. With blocked (or limited) ability to negotiate drug prices, the issue to vote on is IF this causes "theft" by extra profit for the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices since negotation is banned (or reduced).

  If you approximated a negotiated 15% reduction in price would represent a savings of $150 billion. Or to put it another way, you are voting on if the Pharmaceutical Industry STOLE at least $150 billion from taxpayers over that decade.

  Medicare was started in 1966 under the Social Security Administration (SSA) and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It provides medical insurance for those aged 65+, or those receiving  Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for a certain amount of time, or with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). 

  It has 4 parts: Part A (Hospital/Hospice Insurance), Part B. (Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage) and Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage). 

  Medicare Part D's prescription drug benefit has offered affordable coverage to millions of elderly Americans since its January 2006 implementation. Part D has given millions of low-income elderly Americans the ability to obtain drugs that are vital to their health and continued longevity. The estimated cost of that access, however, is substantial: just under $1 trillion in cumulative Medicare spending between 2007 and 2017.

  2) What laws or reasoning blocks medicare from negotiating? {Needs research and debate}

  4) What credible sources say the prices should be far lower if medicare was allowed to negotiate? {Needs research and debate}
  5) How much does Medicare spend on medicines each year? {Needs research and debate}

           each year.
         B. The author of the problem proposal needs to make a best approximation

      Allowing Part D to negotiate drug prices is not a new idea: President Obama supported the repeal during his 2008 campaign and has included versions of the proposal in multiple budgets. So why doesn’t Medicare have the ability to control its drug costs? The short answer is politics.

      Congress approved a landmark program in 2003 to help seniors buy prescription drugs, 
        it slapped on an unusual restriction: The federal government was barred from negotiating
        cheaper prices for those medicines. Instead, the job of holding down costs was outsourced
        to the insurance companies delivering the subsidized new coverage, known as Medicare Part D. 
        The ban on government price bargaining, justified by supporters on free-market grounds, 
        has been derided by critics as a giant gift to the drug industry.

    description: |
      Lawmakers in the 116th Congress have introduced a variety of bills to allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices in Medicare Part D, with the goal of lowering Part D program spending and enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs. Some are stand-alone bills, while others are incorporated in broader legislation to expand health insurance coverage. This discussion focuses on five bills where the primary (or sole) purpose is to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices. While these bills seek to achieve the same overall goal of reducing drug prices in Medicare Part D by allowing the Secretary to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers, they take different approaches to achieve that end.

      It’s time for Medicare to harness the bargaining power of the 43 million Americans in the Part D prescription program to compel pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. The AARP has estimated that Medicare could have saved $14.4 billion on prescription medications in 2016 alone if it had been allowed to negotiate prices.
      While its customers suffer under excessive prices, the pharmaceutical industry continues to revel in record profits. In the third quarter of 2018, 14 drug-makers realized profits of over $1 billion. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical industry CEO pay has climbed to $18 million a year at the same time as one in five Americans confronts health care debt. Big Pharma can certainly afford to sit at the negotiating table with Medicare to work out fairer price points for consumers.
