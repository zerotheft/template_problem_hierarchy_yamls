# The following summary is not an exact amount, but an opinion on an approximation
# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

# {~C~} This describes the problem.  You may want to edit this in your proposal. {~C~}
describe_problem_area: |
  Are medicine prices too high because the pharma industry rigs prices? Are old inventions like Penicillin rigged and too high? Are prices going UP when a non-rigged market would bring them down? Are prices rigged in the USA and is that proven because prices are lower in other countries.

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how the economy is being rigged against citizens. {~C~}
# {~C~} These are just examples and ideas to get you started.  You should delete them and build your own arguments. {~C~}
reasoning: |
  1) Are prices rigged in the USA and is that proven because prices are lower in other countries.
  2) Are prices going UP when a non-rigged market would bring them down?
  3) Are citizens pressured to buy over priced brand drugs instead when they would not be stolen from if they were directed to buy cheaper fully effective generics?
  4) Are old drugs (like penicillin) high priced when they shouldn't be because it is old technology and prices should come down?
  5) Are some drugs low/easy technology (like penicillin) and should be low cost. But instead the prices are rigged to be high?
  6) Are patents being used to steal by rigging prices? 
  7) Ethically penicillin should have tons of competition and low prices, but unethically patents are used in ways you consider unethical?
  8) Does congress betray the US citizens to aid and abet stealing by passing laws?
  9) Ethically congress must investigate and/or fix stealing related to drug prices, but congress betrays citizens by not investigating/fixing the problem?
  10) Does other parts of the US gov betray the US citizens to aid and abet stealing by regulating, passing laws, prosecuting or other behavior?
  11) Ethically other parts of the US gov must investigate and/or fix stealing related to drug prices, but betrays citizens by not investigating/fixing the problem?
  12) Compared to the costs of materials and manufacturing, does that show that drug prices are rigged and stealing is occurring? Especially on generics that should have strong competition?
  13) Does the pharma supply chain cause rigged or prices to be unethically too high? 
  14) Are a few of the items above TRUE, and that causes you to determine that stealing is occurring by pharma companies?
  15) Are a few of the items above TRUE, and that causes you to determine congress (or other parts of gov) are betraying citizens and causing/allowing the crime of theft to occur?
  16) Pharmaceutical settlements in the United States
  17) Does the pharma industry have high spending on lobbying congress?

reasoning_on_size_of_problem:
  reasoning: |
    Antibiotics (like penicillin) have often been invented many decades ago.  They may be verysimple (penicillin came from mold). There should be high competition to causes prices to race very low.

    Approximate what PERCENT of the amount spent on Antibiotics (like penicillin) that would go away if competition is strong and the amount citizens spent came down in this industry.

      10 mL bottle of insulin in the U.S. has a list price of about $450. 

      Jane buys her insulin illegally from Canada, where a comparable bottle of insulin costs about $21.

      According to a 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, nearly 5 million Americans bought their prescription medications from other countries in 2013 to save money, despite federal restrictions. 

      A more recent poll published in November 2016 by Kaiser Family Foundation found 19 million adults in the U.S. imported medication from Canada or other countries. 

      In Canada and other developed countries, the same prescription drugs — manufactured in the same factories, by the same companies — are available for a fraction of the price compared to in the U.S. 

      Take Nexium, for example. AstraZeneca manufactures the stomach-acid drug in Sweden and sells it to consumers in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, New Zealand, India and Turkey. 

      One 40 mg pill costs $7.78 in the U.S. compared to $3.37 in Canada. The price drops even more to $2.21 in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. In India and Turkey, the same pill costs less than 37 cents.

      Three words to watch out for next time you get a new prescription: “Dispense as Written.” Scrawled across the prescription form in your doctor’s hand — or, more likely, ticked off on a check box — the words may seem innocuous enough. But they’re costing you. 

      Because what this note from your doctor to your pharmacist means is, “I won’t let you fill this prescription with a generic.” 

      In many states, the law mandates that pharmacists deliver a generic version whenever available, even when the doctor has prescribed a brand name. 

      But there’s an exception to this mandate, a provision that some might see as a loophole. It’s called “Dispense as Written.” In most states, those words on a prescription — usually in the form of a check mark beside a box with the letters DAW — overrides the mandate.

      While some states require pharmacists to offer generic equivalents unless a doctor specifies “Dispense as Written,” a few jurisdictions are moving to limit the DAW override. In 2009, for example, Massachusetts began requiring doctors to explain in writing why they were insisting — via a DAW — on a brand-name medication as opposed to a generic. The results were dramatic. According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, the state’s Medicaid spending for drugs fell by $150 million within a year.

    url: "https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-who-take-company-cash-tend-to-prescribe-more-brand-name-drugs"
    description: |
      A ProPublica analysis has found for the first time that doctors who receive payments from the medical industry do indeed tend to prescribe drugs differently than their colleagues who don’t. And the more money they receive, on average, the more brand-name medications they prescribe. 

      We matched records on payments from pharmaceutical and medical device makers in 2014 with corresponding data on doctors’ medication choices in Medicare’s prescription drug program.

      Doctors who got money from drug and device makers—even just a meal– prescribed a higher percentage of brand-name drugs overall than doctors who didn’t, our analysis showed. Indeed, doctors who received industry payments were two to three times as likely to prescribe brand-name drugs at exceptionally high rates as others in their specialty.

      "It again confirms the prevailing wisdom … that there is a relationship between payments and brand-name prescribing,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who provided guidance on early versions of ProPublica’s analysis."

      "I do prefer certain drugs over the others based on the quality of the medication and also the benefits that the patients are going to get,” said Dr. Amer Syed of Jersey City, N.J., who received more than $66,800 from companies in 2014 and whose brand-name prescribing rate was more than twice the mean of his peers in internal medicine. “My whole vision of practice is to keep the patients out of the hospital."

      Dr. Felix Tarm, of Wichita, Kansas, likewise prescribed more than twice the rate of brand-name drugs than internal medicine doctors nationally. Tarm, who is in his 70s, said he’s on the verge of retiring and doesn’t draw a salary from his medical practice, instead subsidizing it with the money he receives from drug companies. He said he doesn’t own a pharmacy, a laboratory or an X-ray machine, all ways in which other doctors increase their incomes. 

      "I generally prescribe on the basis of what I think is the best drug,” said Tarm, who received $11,700 in payments in 2014.

      This drug has made headlines, and pyrimethamine (Daraprim) certainly fits the bill of an old drug. 

      Originally developed in 1953, Daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis, a serious infection especially dangerous in pregnancy and in those with a weak immune system like cancer and AIDS patients. 

      Drug company Turing Pharmaceuticals and CEO Martin Shkreli acquired Daraprim in 2015 and hiked its price by over 5000% from $13.50 to $750 per tablet.

      Thiola is another old drug from the 1980's. It's used in the rare disease cystinuria to prevent painful kidney stones and reduce the number of procedures to remove them. 

      It used to cost about $1.50 per 100 milligram (mg) tablet until Retrophin marked it up to about $30 per pill. The problem here the average dose is 400 to 1200 milligram (mg) per day, which means it takes from 120 to 360 pills -- and $3,700 to $11,000 US dollars -- to treat this chronic, lifelong condition every month.

      In August 2015, FDA approved Taro's Keveyis (dichlorphenamide) to treat a very rare genetic disease known as periodic paralysis that leads to episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis, often in legs and arms. 

      Dichlorphenamide is an old drug discovery; it was originally approved in 1958 as the brand Daranide, an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to treat glaucoma; now that brand has been discontinued. 

      Initial doses for paralysis, 50 mg twice a day, ran $8,000 or more for 60 tablets.

      The penicillin antibiotics have been used in clinical practice since the mid-1900s. Although many penicillin derivatives are now obsolete, this diverse group of antibiotics is still widely used in clinical practice. Given its age, long history of use and generic status, many providers consider penicillin to be relatively inexpensive and an economical treatment option when clinically appropriate. Many practitioners are stunned to learn that a daily course of parenteral penicillin still tops $100 per day. Amoxicillin- clavulanic acid, FDA-approved in August 1984 and now available in generic forms, was the fifth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in 2008 in the community, with a 2.4% increase in prescriptions from 2007. While most would not be surprised that there is a marginal increase in cost over amoxillin alone, few would suspect a nearly 10-fold increase in cost-per-day compared with amoxicillin.

      The manufacturer is called Nostrum Laboratories, and the drug for which it hiked the price—by more than 400 percent—is called nitrofurantoin. 

      The company CEO has been unimpressed, telling the Financial Times: “We have to make money when we can.” 

      Nitrofurantoin is on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. It’s been on the market since 1953, developed by a company called Shionogi Pharmaceuticals. 

      For years now, specialists in infectious diseases have been fretting that new antibiotic approvals at the FDA are at an all-time low, and manufacturers are backing away from research. 

      Antibiotics are as expensive to make as any other drug, but they historically have been priced much lower than treatments for heart disease or cancer. That has led some policy makers to imagine, What if we just raised the price? 

      But because they happen in the millions each year, UTIs represent a substantial money-making opportunity for the handful of companies that manufacture drugs targeting them — even more so because the bacteria that commonly cause UTIs have been growing resistant to other antibiotics.

      Specialists in infectious disease are protesting a gigantic overnight increase in the price of a 62-year-old drug that is the standard of care for treating a life-threatening parasitic infection.

      The drug, called Daraprim, was acquired in August by Turing Pharmaceuticals, a start-up run by a former hedge fund manager.

      Daraprim is the standard first treatment for toxoplasmosis, in combination with an antibiotic called sulfadiazine. 

      Turing immediately raised the price to $750 a tablet from $13.50, bringing the annual cost of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

      Daraprim cost only about $1 a tablet several years ago, but the drug’s price rose sharply after CorePharma acquired it. 

      Cycloserine, a drug used to treat dangerous multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, was just increased in price to $10,800 for 30 pills from $500 after its acquisition by Rodelis Therapeutics. Scott Spencer, general manager of Rodelis, said the company needed to invest to make sure the supply of the drug remained reliable. 

      Doxycycline, an antibiotic, went from $20 a bottle in October 2013 to $1,849 by April 2014, according to the two lawmakers.

Too often, however, some brand-name drug companies attempt to patent features of drugs that do not represent true innovation. Some attempt to bury competition from generic and biosimilar drugs indefinitely by finding ways to repackage existing inventions in later patents. 

      AbbVie Inc.’s rheumatoid arthritis drug HUMIRA® (adalimumab) is the best-selling prescription drug in the world, with over $12 billion in U.S. sales per year. Humira was approved in 2002, and it now makes more money annually than all of the NFL teams, combined. The initial patent on the product expired in 2016, but within the three years before expiration, the company applied for and obtained over 75 patents that would extend its monopoly to 2034 – and keep this enormously expensive treatment inaccessible to many patients.

      Drug companies also benefit from patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products. These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition.

      Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity. When evergreening, pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill in order to preserve their patents. A 2018 study in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences found that 78 percent of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.

      "When American voters say Congress is owned by big companies,” U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said on the floor last week. “This bill is exactly what they are talking about."

      Part of the selling point of the 21st Century Cures Act is the hefty amount of NIH funding for medical research. It also provides state grants to battle opioid abuse and mental health research. But patient advocacy groups and pro-patient politicians say the bill benefits the industry and exposes patients to poorly and possibly dangerous pharmaceuticals and medical devices. 

      "It is sorely disappointing that Congress gave Big Pharma and the medical device industry an early Christmas present by passing the 21st Century Cures Act,” Dr. Michael Carome of the watchdog group Public Citizen said in a statement."

      Big Pharma rakes in an estimated $325 billion in the U.S., and medical device companies make about $150 billion. Under the new bill, they stand to save billions to bring new drugs and devices to market. 

      The bill allows the FDA to use less scientifically rigorous research, fewer clinical trials — which are expensive for Big Pharma — and use “real world evidence” to approve drugs. 

      Part of the bill also allows drug makers to promote off-label uses — uses not approved by the FDA — of their products to insurance companies.

      It is a bedrock principle of capitalism that as competition erodes profits on established products, enterprises will invest in innovation to earn higher profits from new products. US law governing prescription pharmaceutical markets abandons that principle and gives every new drug a long-term monopoly that prohibits competition. It also discourages competition between medicines based on comparative price or effectiveness. High prices and slow innovation cycles are the inevitable result and will remain so unless Congress makes fundamental changes in existing law.

      Federal law prohibits the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from approving a copy of a new drug for a period of seven to 12 years even if there are no patents. The FDA is also prohibited from approving a generic drug anytime a claim of patent infringement is alleged – a policy that has encouraged many frivolous patent claims just to delay competition. Drug patents also get extensions of up to five years and then an additional six-month extension for conducting studies of the new drug’s suitability for use in children. Collectively, all of these special monopolies prevent competition and keep prices high.

      A rational consumer would not pay $10 for a medication when their affliction could be relieved for 10 cents. Unfortunately, once a medication is prescribed by a physician, only that medication or an approved generic copy can be legally dispensed even if a lower cost alternative medicine exists.

      US lawmakers have succumbed to the absurd argument that direct price negotiations by the government is akin to price controls and have prohibited Medicare from directly negotiating prices.

      Why does Congress, in the face of outrageous drug prices, continue to advance laws like the 21st Century Cures Act which bestow even more monopolies on the pharmaceutical industry? Quite simply, the pharmaceutical lobby has used its money and influence to sell the false notion that high drug prices and monopolies are necessary to support the high cost of research. Yet public financial data shows that high drug prices simply produce high profits!

      Under current law, ownership of the patents on drugs discovered with taxpayer money is given away to the academic institutions that discover them. They license those patents to the pharmaceutical industry in exchange for the payment of a royalty which the public actually pays since the royalty increases the price charged for a drug. Federal law essentially socializes the cost of drug discovery while privatizing the profits since it does nothing to limit the prices that can be charged or the profits that can be earned from drugs discovered at public expense. 

      The monopolies created by Hatch-Waxman and subsequent legislation providing 12 years of exclusivity for biologic drugs clearly went too far in compensating the pharmaceutical industry at the public’s expense. 

      A drug which provides little or no incremental value over existing products gets the same ability to charge a monopoly price for an extended period of time as a life-saving breakthrough that required 10 times the risk and investment to discover. 

      For decades, Congress has simply been transferring wealth from ordinary citizens to the pharmaceutical industry. While claiming to believe in free market capitalism, it has created a web of monopolies which cause the United States to pay the world’s highest prices for drugs even though it is the largest purchaser.

      “There is a very aggressive lobby that is finding any and all means to thwart any reform to a system that has produced very lucrative profits,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, an epidemiologist and lawyer at Harvard Medical School who follows drug legislation. “Everything that’s coming out is being hit and hit hard — even stuff that’s common-sensical.” 

      Members of Congress who deal with health policy have spent much of the year advancing proposals to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, none of which was intended to reduce drug prices. 

      The pharmaceutical and health products industries spent $145 million on lobbying for the first half of 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 

      Drug makers gave $4.5 million to congressional campaigns in that period, including six-figure donations to House Speaker Paul Ryan; Representative Greg Walden, a Republican of Oregon who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a Kaiser Health News analysis found.

      Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than $62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the most it has ever spent on political campaigns. The massive influx of campaign cash benefited members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing. Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, "would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs."

      President Trump has long promised to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, but he has avoided taking serious action to drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his administration with industry insiders. 

      One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.

      Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma officials have filled at least 16 current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies.

      Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially. 

      In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for Gilead—the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high prices on a cure for hepatitis C. Since joining the administration, Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump’s Drug Pricing and Innovation Working Group.” However, the working group has proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas. 

      President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former president of Eli Lilly—one of the companies that is working to keep drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer—to oversee his efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human services.

      President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while benefiting the pharmaceutical industry. However, he was successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of $76 billion.

      Hargan’s subordinate allegedly began pushing to buy the drug sold by Alvogen around the same time lobbyists working for the company began lobbying HHS. 

      Weeks after that HHS contract was awarded, a lawsuit was unsealed alleging that HHS had been previously defrauded into buying that same drug from another company. The lawsuit alleges the drug “is more likely to perpetuate an influenza pandemic than to stop one.”

      Avalere Health explored and reported how much pharma companies have actually paid the FDA through PDUFA, adding up the collected for different types of applications (e.g., for each prescription drug application with clinical data, the fee in 2016 was over $2 million). This report found that since PDUFA was passed in 1992, pharma companies have contributed $7.67 billion to the federal agency’s coffers. This creates a interconnectedness between the two entities: a marriage between Big Pharma and the government can potentially blur the intent of government regulation and the role that it plays in protecting citizens.

      Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because the drugs are difficult to manufacture.

After an 18-month investigation into the company’s pricing, the Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing and pricing strategy designed to “maximize revenue with little concern for access or affordability.”

      The pharmaceutical supply chain faces its own set of challenges, including supply chain visibility, drug counterfeiting, cold-chain shipping, and raising prescription drug prices, which can significantly increase out-of-pocket costs for patients. 

      The pharmaceutical supply chain greatly affects drug costs. Consumers face higher out-of-pocket expenses and health plans deal with higher drug spend. 

      A report from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) found that the complexity and number of players involved in the drug supply chain may one of the main reasons prescription drug costs are making headlines. 

      Prescription drugs greatly depend on several negotiations between wholesalers, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, and insurers, according to the report. The authors noted that rebates have increased over the past few years, but out-of-pocket costs for patients are soaring.

    description: |
      Typically, a drug passes through wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), insurers, and pharmacies before it winds up in the hands of the patient. 

      Additionally, the supply chain varies from drug to drug, with some requiring temperature-sensitive handling and storage. This can add another layer of costs for an already costly drug. 

      While negotiations between PBMs and manufacturers can result in significant rebates, the authors said that the current system could incentivize PBMs to prefer drugs with higher list prices and rebates. 

      In the study, the authors discussed multiple examples of how the complex supply chain can increase costs for patients. 

      In one example, a hypothetical patient named Diane is prescribed an HIV medication with a list price of $3000. Although Diane’s insurer receives a 20% rebate, her coinsurance is $612 because it is based on the list price. Diane pays more than $100 above what she would have paid if the coinsurance was based on the negotiated price, according to the study. 

      For this example, the PBM also generates revenue and charges fees based on the list price. The authors report that the PBM earns $522.25 for the HIV drug, which includes $308 for managing the pharmacy benefit for the insurer and $214.23 because the PBM also owns the specialty pharmacy that dispensed the drug, according to the study. 

      The multiple examples throughout the report show how the supply chain can increase the out-of-pocket costs for both specialty and non-specialty drugs.

      From 2007 to 2016, Mylan raised the list price of its EpiPen about 500%, from just under $100 to more than $600. From 2002 to 2013, insulin prices more than Tripled. From 2012 to 2019, the average price of AbbVie’s rheumatoid-arthritis drug Humira climbed from $19,000 a year to $60,000 a year—and that’s after rebates. These are dramatic examples of a systemwide problem; prices for brand-name drugs are rising at a rate that far outstrips inflation. 

      What’s behind these rapid price hikes? It’s a simple question with a complicated answer that involves three central entities; drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers. Together, they create a complicated supply chain that helps drive drug prices aggressively upward. “We have a system that is all engine and no brake,” said Michelle Mello, a professor at Stanford Law School and a professor of health research and policy at Stanford Medicine.
