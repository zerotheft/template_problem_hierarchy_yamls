# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

describe_problem_area: |
  For the last 200+ years, the U.S. has experienced strong GDP growth annually. The rigged economy is about how the GDP is stolen so the appropriate amounts stopped going to the working class. 

  Here is what should be debated in "Share buyback" part of the proposed rigging of the economy:

  * GDP growth turns into: a) profits and b) normal share price growth.

  * Profits would normally get to works by:

  1) Taxes on profits
  2) Investors pay taxes on dividends
  3) The working class' retirement is 401k and IRAs so that means it is in the stock market.  If share-buy-back redirects much of the GDP growth (company's profits) far more to company executives, then the working class's retirements are greatly held back, in a rigged way.
  4) The wealthiest 1% own 56% of the USA stock market. Since they can keep it there nearly forever, they can never pay tax on all of the stock they keep holding. Share buy-back makes it so the taxes can be nearly never paid by the wealthy who hold the stock.
  5) Profits would often be invested in growing USA companies. This creates more jobs. This makes the USA more competitive. With US laws violating how Germany protects against share-buy-back theft, then USA workers are robbed from jobs and the economy being as strong.
  6) Workers in the past have been able to negotiate to have salary increases happen because of that profits. When the profits are quickly redirected to share buy-back, then employees are locked out of as much of salary increases.
  7) There can be more ways that the wealth transfer to the investor classes happens.

  It is important to look how the USA used to not do this. Did US congress sell out the American people and pass laws over the last 50 years to make share buy-back far better for investors?

  Look at Germany has laws against share-buy-back, and understand the ethics that they do that so the wealthy don't rig the economy. See if you view the ethics of their laws as needed to prevent the US wealthy investor class (and corporate execs) from stealing in a rigged economy way.
  
  Do you consider US Congress to have committed the crime of stealing if they don't have the same laws as Germany (that prevents shared-buy-back rigged economy)?

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how the economy is being rigged against citizens. {~C~}
# {~C~} These are just examples and ideas to get you started.  You should delete them and build your own arguments. {~C~}
reasoning: |
  1) How much is estimated to be taken away from the 99% of citizens by share buyback:
  2) Does Germany have laws against share-buy-back:
  3) Do you consider it theft if we don't have some/all of Germany's laws to prevent share-buy-back theft?
  4) Did US Congress pass laws over the last 50 years to make share buy-back a powerful tool for the investor class that owns the majority of the US Stock market?
  5) Do investors not pay tax if they buy-and-hold. But more specifically that share-buy-back drives up the price far higher:
  6) Profits would often be invested in growing USA companies. This creates more jobs. This makes the USA more competitive. With US laws violating how Germany protects against share-buy-back theft, then USA workers are robbed from jobs and the economy being as strong.
  7) Workers in the past have been able to negotiate to have salary increases happen because of that profits. When the profits are quickly redirected to share buy-back, then employees are locked out of as much of salary increases.

      Still, U.S. companies are on track to reach $1 trillion in buybacks this year, according to Goldman Sachs. Already, companies have authorized over $750 billion in buybacks, and the overall pace of buybacks is almost double last year’s. The previous annual record for buyback activity was set in 2007, at $589 billion.

      Corporate spending on buybacks by the 364 largest U.S. repurchasers reached an all-time high of over $3 trillion during the five-year period ending in 2019. This increase was generally considered to have been fueled by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which sought to repatriate cash held by subsidiaries overseas. So while we expected buybacks to return to prior levels after 2018, this was not the case.

      In 2019, as shown in date below, 364 of the S&P 500’s largest repurchasers covered in this report spent $709 billion to buy back shares, down just 8% from the $770 billion in 2018.

      Companies have been spending record amounts to buy back their own stock. Recently released research from strategy consulting firm Fortuna Advisors indicates that the 364 public companies with the largest-volume stock repurchase programs spent an all-time high of more than $3 trillion on those programs during the five-year period ending in 2019.

      Analyst and investor consensus generally holds that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act fueled this increase by encouraging companies to repatriate funds previously held overseas. Buybacks spiked in 2018, to $770 billion. In 2019, however, volume did not fall back to its prior levels but was down just 8 percent, to $709 billion.

      More than 95% of the buyback programs worldwide are through an open-market method, whereby the company announces the buyback program and then repurchases shares in the open market (stock exchange). In the late 20th and the early 21st century, there was a sharp rise in the volume of share repurchases in the United States: US$5 billion in 1980 rose to US$349 billion in 2005. Large share repurchases started later in Europe than in the United States, but are nowadays a common practice around the world.

      “The absolute dollar value of buyback announcements reached a record $939 billion in 2018. The cycle has likely now peaked for issuance, buybacks and M&A as the global economy slips slowly into sub-trend growth and valuations are less attractive,” said Joyce Chang, Chair of Global Research at J.P. Morgan.

      “On the whole, we feel the concerns about the purported long-term harms of buybacks are overblown. When capital is returned to shareholders via buybacks, investors reinvest this capital elsewhere; they do not simply sit on the cash. Corporate buybacks have returned $5 trillion to shareholders since 2009,” said Head of Long-term Strategy at J.P. Morgan, Jan Loeys.

      Even as the United States continues to experience its longest economic expansion since World War II, concern is growing that soaring corporate debt will make the economy susceptible to a contraction that could get out of control. The root cause of this concern is the trillions of dollars that major U.S. corporations have spent on open-market repurchases — aka “stock buybacks” — since the financial crisis a decade ago. In 2018 alone, with corporate profits bolstered by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, companies in the S&P 500 Index did a combined $806 billion ($860,000,000,000) in buybacks, about $200 billion ($200,000,000,000) more than the previous record set in 2007. The $370 billion ($370,000,000,000) in repurchases which these companies did in the first half of 2019 is on pace for total annual buybacks that are second only to 2018. When companies do these buybacks, they deprive themselves of the liquidity that might help them cope when sales and profits decline in an economic downturn.

      Making matters worse, the proportion of buybacks funded by corporate bonds reached as high as 30% in both 2016 and 2017, according to JPMorgan Chase. The International Monetary Fund’s Global Financial Stability Report, issued in October, highlights “debt-funded payouts” as a form of financial risk-taking by U.S. companies that “can considerably weaken a firm’s credit quality.”

      The 465 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2019 that were publicly listed between 2009 and 2018 spent, over that decade, $4.3 trillion ($4,300,000,000,000) on buybacks, equal to 52% of net income, and another $3.3 trillion ($3,300,000,000,000)  on dividends, an additional 39% of net income. In 2018 alone, even with after-tax profits at record levels because of the Republican tax cuts, buybacks by S&P 500 companies reached an astounding 68% of net income, with dividends absorbing another 41%.

      The German Corporation Control and Transparency Act (KonTraG) became effective on May 1, 1998 and permitted German firms to repurchase common and preferred shares under the following conditions and subject to the following requirements. A share repurchase program has to be first authorized by the annual general meeting of shareholders (AGM). The AGM has to decide on the maximum amount of shares to be repurchased during the program. The amount must not exceed ten percent of total shares outstanding3 and the repurchase has to be made out of distributable profits. The AGM also determines the length of the period during which transactions can take place. This period cannot be longer than 18 months. Moreover, shareholders must decide on the precise buyback method unless the firm plans to repurchase shares through the open market.4 AGM approval has to be reported to Germany’s financial services authority (BaFin) immediately. Before a firm can repurchase shares on the open market it has to make a public announcement. This announcement does not have to state the volume of shares to be repurchased and it is not binding for the firm, i.e. the firm can choose not to transact. If it repurchases shares, transactions have to be conducted in a way such that all the firm’s shareholders are treated exactly the same. Moreover, transactions must not be used for the purpose of trading. On the AGM following a transaction the firm has to report why it bought back shares, how many shares it bought back and at which price it bought back the shares.

    description: |
      Until 1998 share repurchases were essentially prohibited in Germany. In 1998 a new law came into force that allows share repurchases. Under this law firms are allowed to buy back up to 10% of their shares. A firm wishing to buy back shares has to follow a standardized two step procedure. As a first step the shareholders’ meeting (with simple majority) has to grant the managerial board the permission to buy back shares. This permission has to specify the maximum number of shares to be bought back (not more than 10% of shares outstanding), the minimum and maximum price to be paid per share, and the time of validity of the permission (initially not longer than 18 months; since 2008 no longer than 5 years).

      This permission gives the managerial board the right, but not the obligation, to buy back shares.

      Other advanced economies like the United Kingdom and Hong Kong require companies to disclose stock buybacks within one day, but here in the United States you can go an entire quarter without disclosing. So let’s change that.

      In the absence of a repeal of Rule 10b-18, full disclosure makes sense. Under Rule 10b-18, companies need not disclose the actual amount of buybacks that they do on any given day, either at the time when they are done or after the fact. If the SEC is going to continue to permit open-market repurchases by companies, it should at least require each company to reveal immediately, on a daily basis, how much it has done on any given day so that the agency and the public can assess whether stock-price manipulation is going on. 

      It would then also be transparent if executives and other insiders have timed the sales of their own personal holdings of the companies’ shares (including those acquired from exercising stock options or the vesting of stock awards) to take advantage of price boosts from buyback activity.

      For over three decades now, since the first term of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, the government agency that is supposed to regulate the stock market has, through (the once-obscure) Rule 10b-18, promoted the looting of business corporations for the sake of stock-price manipulation.

    description: |
      Repurchases done on the open market, which constitute the vast majority of all buybacks, are nothing but manipulation of the stock market. So why are companies allowed to do them? Because of the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan as president on a platform of market deregulation. In November 1982, after Reagan had appointed Wall Street banker John Shad as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency adopted Rule 10b-18, which permits a company to do buybacks that can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars per day, trading day after trading day, without fear of being charged with stock-price manipulation. Rule 10b-18, which remains in force 35 years later, is a license to loot the U.S. business corporation.

      The most persistent challenge to this corrupt practice has come from Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who in 2015 wrote two highly critical letters to former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, and who has recently challenged the prescription drug lobby group PhRMA to reconcile its claim that the pharmaceutical companies need high drug prices to fund research and development with the fact that the major companies spend virtually all their profits on buybacks and dividends.

      But the right is right: Buybacks are no more pernicious than dividends in “stealing money” from firms, that could otherwise be used for worker pay and productive investment.

      And they’re dead wrong that there’s no difference between the two. Buybacks steal money not so much from corporate wages, but much more obviously and explicitly: from taxes that contribute to our common public purse.

      Democrats have argued that the Republican tax cuts have funded increased buybacks. While this is true, the damage done by corporate stock buybacks over the past decades has been systemic.

      Short of a Congressional ban on buybacks, as Ms. Baldwin proposes, the S.E.C. should immediately rescind Rule 10b-18, and confront the reality of stock market manipulation that open market repurchases entail. If Congress and regulators do not take action to rein in buybacks, the rampant economic inequality that already afflicts the United States will only get worse.

      The 1934 legislation didn’t bar stock buybacks, per se, but it barred companies from doing anything to manipulate their stock prices. Companies knew that if they did a stock buyback, it could open them up to accusations from the Securities and Exchange Commission of trying to manipulate their stock price, so most just didn’t.

      In 1982, the SEC adopted rule 10b-18, which provides a “safe harbor” for companies in stock buybacks. As long as companies stick to specific parameters — such as not buying more than 25 percent of the stock’s average daily trading volume in a single day — they won’t be dinged for stock manipulation.

      Beyond the SEC’s 1982 rule that provided a safe harbor for buybacks, shareholder primacy on Wall Street has been on the rise. So-called “activist investors” who buy large numbers of a company’s shares to try to get seats on the board or effect change within the company have contributed to a rise in “short-termism” on Wall Street.

The amendments are intended to simplify and update the safe harbor provisions in light of market developments since the Rule's adoption. To enhance the transparency of issuer repurchases, we also are adopting amendments to a number of regulations and forms to require disclosure of all issuer repurchases (open market and private transactions), regardless of whether the repurchases are effected in accordance with the safe harbor rule.

      For most of the 20th century, stock buybacks were deemed illegal because they were thought to be a form of stock market manipulation. But since 1982, when they were essentially legalized by the SEC, buybacks have become perhaps the most popular financial engineering tool in the C-Suite tool shed. And it’s obvious why Wall Street loves them: Buying back company stock can inflate a company’s share price and boost its earnings per share-metrics that often guide lucrative executive bonuses.

      As Reuters wrote recently, “Stock buybacks enrich the bosses even when business sags.”

      But Rule 10b-18, the rule proposed in 1982, gives executives total power (and a blank check) to determine their own incentive-based compensation.

      Prior to the adoption of Rule 10b-18 in 1982 stock buybacks were almost unheard of in the U.S. as companies feared that such share repurchases would be deemed to be manipulative and subject them to prosecution by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rule 10b-18’s safe harbor conditions are designed to minimize the market impact of the issuer’s repurchases, thereby allowing the market to establish a security’s price based on independent market forces without undue influence by the issuer.

      Rule 10B-18 is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule that is intended to reduce liability for companies (and their affiliated purchasers) when the company repurchases shares of the company's common stock. Rule 10B-18 is considered a safe harbor provision. A safe harbor is a legal provision to reduce or eliminate legal or regulatory liability in certain situations as long as certain conditions are met. If the company abides by the four conditions of Rule 10B-18 when it is repurchasing the shares, the SEC will not deem the transactions in violation of anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      By contrast, when a company distributes cash in a buyback, only the investors who choose to sell back their shares owe any tax. If they have held their shares for more than a year, they pay tax at the long-term capital gain rate, which tops out at the same 23.8 percent rate that applies to dividends. But there are three wrinkles that make the tax treatment of buybacks much more generous than the tax treatment of dividends.

      When excess cash is used to repurchase company stock, instead of increasing dividend payments, shareholders have the opportunity to defer capital gains if share prices increase. Traditionally, buybacks are taxed at a capital gains tax rate, whereas dividends are subject to ordinary income tax.﻿ If the stock has been held for more than one year, the gains would be subject to a lower capital gains rate.

      Buybacks offer a tax advantage over dividends when companies wish to return part of their cash to shareholders. As Siegel (2006) states, when shareholders receive cash dividends, these are treated as ordinary income and the receipts are taxed at the prevailing personal income tax rate in the same year they are received. However, when companies buy back their own shares, any capital gains created for the shareholders are not taxed until the gains are realized; also, capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate.

      Most investors need to pay a tax on their dividend payments, which amounts to 0-40% in the US. On the other hand, investors don’t need to pay a tax from the share price going up until they sell, when they will have to pay a capital gains tax.

      For long-term holders, it can be better to have the shares gain value from buybacks instead of getting a dividend and having to pay a tax right away. In this way, the money stays in the investment and can gain compound interest over time.

      A share buyback refers to the purchase by a company of its shares from the marketplace. The biggest benefit of a share buyback is that it reduces the number of shares outstanding for a company. Share repurchases usually increase per-share measures of profitability like earnings-per-share (EPS) and cash-flow-per-share, and also improve performance measures like return on equity. These improved metrics will generally drive the share price higher over time, resulting in capital gains for the shareholders. However, these profits will not be taxed until the shareholder sells the shares and realizes the gains made on the shareholdings.

      If you hold stock in a standard (taxable) brokerage account, you'll probably have to pay tax on the dividends you receive each year. Though most U.S. stock dividends meet the definition of "qualified dividends," this still translates to a 15% or 20% dividend tax rate for the majority of investors.

      On the other hand, you don't pay tax on capital gains until you sell the investment. Buybacks help increase earnings per share, and therefore can help boost a stock's price, but as long as you hold the stock in your account, you won't have to pay a dime in taxes.

      According to our research, when trillions of dollars of corporate cash are extracted from companies through buybacks, on top of dividends, the result is a dramatic concentration of income among the richest American households and the destruction of middle-class employment opportunities.

      In 2003, the S.E.C. revealed that it was aware of the use of buybacks to manipulate the stock market. The agency acknowledged, in amending Rule 10b-18 to include block trades, that “during the late 1990s, it was reported that many companies were spending more than half their net income on massive buyback programs that were intended to boost share prices — often supporting their share price at levels far above where they would otherwise trade.” But its 2003 amendment was hardly a solution.

      But right now, without shareholder approval, corporate boards freely swap a safe asset (cash) for a risky asset (stock).

      In the end, it’s not the executives who get hurt. It’s the rank-and-file employees, as well as the investors who will see their pensions and 401(k)s decline.

      When a company executes a stock buyback, they raise the price of that company’s shares for a period of time, but the funds spent on buybacks are then unavailable to be spent on the types of corporate activities that could make the company more productive over the long term: investments in future productivity and in the workforce. Stock buybacks are one of the drivers of our imbalanced economy, in which corporate profits and shareholder payments continue to grow while wages for typical workers stay flat.

    description: |
      While buybacks are very beneficial to corporate executives and wealthy Wall Street investors, they end up harming workers. Before the stock buyback explosion, companies would often use excess profits to increase worker pay and benefits, to invest in new equipment, or to expand into new markets and create more jobs.

      Now that the majority of profits go to buybacks, there is little money left to invest in workers and the future growth of companies.

      So take Craig Menear, the chairman and CEO of Home Depot. On a conference call with investors in February 2018, he and his team mentioned their “plan to repurchase approximately $4 billion of outstanding shares during the year.” The next day, he sold 113,687 shares, netting $18 million .* The following day, he was granted 38,689 new shares, and promptly unloaded 24,286 shares for a profit of $4.5 million ($4,500,000). Though Menear’s stated compensation in SEC filings was $11.4 million for 2018, stock sales helped him earn an additional $30 million for the year.

      By contrast, the median worker pay at Home Depot is $23,000 a year. If the money spent on buybacks had been used to boost salaries, the Roosevelt Institute and the National Employment Law Project calculated, each worker would have made an additional $18,000 a year.

      A new report finds that big companies could have given their workers thousands of dollars’ worth of raises with the money they spent on their own shares.

      “Workers around the country have been pushing for higher wages, but the answer is always, ‘We can’t afford it. We’d have to do layoffs or raise prices,’” Tung said. “That is just not true. The money is there. It’s just getting siphoned out of the company instead of reinvested into it.”

      Corporate profits and executive pay today are sky high, while wages for most of our nation’s workers have remained low and stagnant over the last 50 years.

      For decades, U.S. workers have seen stagnant wage growth despite rapidly increasing productivity, and U.S. companies have reinvested less and less of their profits, now at a record high, into their employees, operations, expansion, and new job creation (Shambaugh, Nunn, Liu, and Nantz 2017; Gutierrez and Phillipon 2016). Our analysis confirms this shift by showing an outsized share of corporate profits being spent on stock buybacks.

      Sen. Sanders wrote: “Instead of putting resources into innovative ways to build their businesses or hire new employees, corporations are pumping their record-breaking profits into buying back their own stock and increasing dividends to benefit their executives and wealthy shareholders at the expense of their workers.”

      So too, on July 13, buybacks found their way into Hillary Clinton’s first major economics speech of her campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee. As she phrased it: “In recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn’t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company’s future success.

      Buybacks undercut investment in the productive capabilities of the labor force that are essential for achieving stable employment with decent pay.

      Buybacks constitute a manipulation of the stock market that leaves most Americans worse off.
