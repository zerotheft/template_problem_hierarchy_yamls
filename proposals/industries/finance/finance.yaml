describe_problem_area: |
  The modern day rigged economy hides in complexity and jargon, and Wall Street is a perfect example of this.
  Even the Federal Reserve uses the term "Quantitative Easing" instead of money printing in order to keep citizens in the dark.
  The problem with rigged economy stealing in Wall Street/Finance is that ONE ENGINE of their theft occurs for many years and is undetected until it blows up or is uncovered.
  Our approximation must include what we unethical actions are happening right now, since only later will they be uncovered.
  Here are examples in the finance industry:
  1) Share-buy-back: We must dig down deep to consider if this is unethical and stealing mass quantities of wealth in a rigged economy. Do execs haul away wealth in non-free market stock price run-ups through buy-backs?  Does this mean the money they take doesn't go to normal citizen's 401ks and IRA returns?
  2) Do High Frequency Trading firms steal by front-running-trades?  Was it theft by the rigged economy?  See the book "Flash Boys".
  3) Do any US stock exchanges create special TRADE TYPES that effectively are tools to accomplish stealing through front-running-trades?  Was it theft by the rigged economy?  See the book "Flash Boys".
  4) When Dark Pools were used, did it cause main-street investors to have trades happen away from the main exchanges? Did this cause stealing by having the different prices in different exchanges? Did high frequency or other firms front-run and steal by leveraging the price differences between Dark Pool and main exchanges?  See the book "Flash Boys".
  5) Did the NASDAQ or their traders, prior to 1994, steal by a rigged economy? Did they avoid 1/8th prices and round up to 1/4th prices in order to make a bigger spread?  Were they able to steal by doing this?  If what they did was ethical, then why did they stop it in 1994 when it was uncovered by the academics?
  6) Eliot Spitzer: Was he able to find rigged economy events, one after another?  Did he force companies to settle because of their aledged rigged economy theft?
  7) 2008 Mortage crisis:
   a) Credit-Default-Swap (CDSes) insurance. The Fed purchased blow-up mortgages that were created because AIG sold CDSes that they couldn't pay off. Did the Fed have to then buy over $1 Trillion of these over-inflated mortgages (MBSes) that were so insured?
      Did the Fed Chairman's autobiography say he paid PEAK price for the MBSes instead of the market rates after they blew up (when the Fed purchased them)?  If so, this would be rigged theft by the Fed of US citizen's tax dollars for this $1 Trillion+ bail-out purchase.
   b) Mortgage Originators: Where they unethical in creating a massive increase in blow-up mortgages (compared to other times)?
   c) Did banks rob by using the FDIC insurance fund because their alleged unethical behavior by stealing through a rigged economy blew up their banks? This would have robbed citizens that had their money in savings accounts at these banks since the citizen’s money was lost in alleged blown-up mortgages.
   d) Did credit rating agencies act unethically because they knew they were taking money to give higher ratings than companies should have gotten. See the NYC article from the senior employee who leaked what happened.
  8) Savings & Loan bail outs: Fraud real estate loans that blew up because if systematic rigged economy theft.
  9) Long-term Capital Management blow-up and bailout (1989).
  10) The LIBOR was rigged. This is a cross-borders issues. But people must consider if this was extreme theft and using the complexity of finance to hide it. It could represent theft for some number of years, until uncovered.
  There are far far more than can be listed here. Does this list show that there is a systemic problem?  Does Wall Streat/Finance steal for years and people don't know, until they blow up the economy or are caught?
  Is the pattern of Wall Street/Finance successfully stealing in a hidden way for years so systematic that we must approxiate that a similar amount of theft is underway, and has been for many years now.  Can we approximate that such theft will continue until it, too, will later be uncovered?

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}

reasoning: |
  1) Are any of these examples of rigged prices, rigged economy, or theft? Enough that you consider the Finance industry rigged (and we can declare a problem exists):
   a) Did the 1/8th price rigging system happen on NASDAQ up to 1994? (xxxx research article)
   b) Did the "Flash Boys" book claim or prove that some exchanges unethically sold special order types to front run trades and steal?  Was money stolen this way?
   c) Have High Frequency trading firms at any time stolen by front running trades?
   d) Have some Dark Pools at any time stolen by enabling front running trades?  If they stopped, why did they stop?
   e) Did the "Flash Boys" book claim or prove that some exchanges unethically sold special order types to front run trades and steal?  Was money stolen this way?
   f) Did AIG (or any other CDS insurance sellers) behave unethically, causing money to be stolen from citizens (in 2008)?  Did some of them cause the 2008 mortgage crisis to occur or contribute to it?  Could their behavior be considered unethical or rigging the economy?
   g) Did Mortgage Underwriters have behave unethically, causing money to be stolen from citizens (in 2008)?  Did some of them cause the 2008 mortgage crisis to occur or contribute to it?  Could their behavior be considered unethical or rigging the economy?
   h) Did investment banks (such as warehouse loans) behave unethically, causing money to be stolen from citizens (in 2008)?  Did some of them cause the 2008 mortgage crisis to occur or contribute to it?  Could their behavior be consider unethical or rigging the economy?
   i) Did rating agencies behave unethically, causing money to be stolen from citizens (in 2008)?  Did some of them cause the 2008 mortgage crisis to occur or contribute to it?  Could their behavior be considered unethical or rigging the economy?
   j) Did the LIBOR system cause a rigged economy? Did some people have money stolen from them because of it?     
   k) Did Eliot Spitzer, former AG of NYC, prove a rigged economy by Wall Street or Finance firms by the settlements he achieved?

    description: |
      Congress and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized decades ago that this kind of practice could manipulate the stock market, and before 1982, open-market stock buybacks were functionally impermissible. Rule 10b-18, the stock buyback “safe harbor,” was a sharp departure from the proposals made by the SEC in the 1970s that clearly recognized that a large volume of stock buybacks would manipulate the market. Rule 10b-18 leaves stock buybacks virtually unregulated, allowing companies to spend billions a year with no oversight or accountability. This is out of step with the spirit of our securities laws, which is to “insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets.”

      But the main effect of repurchases in the short term is to reduce the number of shares available on the open market for trading, meaning that the value of each remaining share goes up in value. Though there is no practical improvement in the sales of a company’s goods, customer satisfaction, or efficiency gains in the production process, share prices go up through the removal of share volume.

      The current regulatory regime for stock buybacks creates the potential for corporate executives to personally gain during stock buyback programs. These buybacks create incentives for corporate insiders to sell the shares they own, which can create a substantial conflict of interest.

      As Reuters wrote recently, “Stock buybacks enrich the bosses even when business sags.”

      Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a recent interview with the Boston Globe that “stock buybacks create a sugar high for the corporations. It boosts prices in the short run, but the real way to boost the value of a corporation is to invest in the future, and they are not doing that.”

      In the end, it’s not the executives who get hurt. It’s the rank-and-file employees, as well as the investors who will see their pensions and 401(k)s decline.

    description: |
      C-suite executives use share buybacks to manipulate stock prices for their own benefit, and no one else’s.

      The buyback policy reinforced the negative trends resulting from the doctrine of shareholder primacy—including a decline in labor’s share of national income, higher pay for corporate executives and greater income inequality, reduced corporate investment, and slower economic growth.

      The evidence shows that buybacks give executives an opportunity to take significant cash off the table, breaking the pay-performance link,” Jackson said in a 2018 speech. He added that SEC rules do not prohibit or even discourage such self-dealing.

    description: |
      Over the last decade, instead of investing in employee compensation and new infrastructure, companies have put 94% of their profits into stock buybacks and dividends. The increasing financialization of the economy is only made worse by these buybacks, and results in corporations squeezing as much profit as they can out of their employees. At the end of the day, workers see a decrease in their bargaining power and a dramatic rise in income inequality, all in the name of maximizing “shareholder value”. 

      While buybacks are very beneficial to corporate executives and wealthy Wall Street investors, they end up harming workers. Before the stock buyback explosion, companies would often use excess profits to increase worker pay and benefits, to invest in new equipment, or to expand into new markets and create more jobs.

      Now that the majority of profits go to buybacks, there is little money left to invest in workers and the future growth of companies.

      No one could say for sure what caused the flash crash—for the same reason no one could prove that high-frequency traders were front-running the orders of ordinary investors. The data didn’t exist. But Brad sensed that the investment community was not persuaded by the SEC’s explanation and by the assurances of the stock exchanges that all was well inside them. A lot of them asked the same question he was asking himself: Isn’t there a much deeper question of how this one snowball caused a deadly avalanche? He watched the most sophisticated investors respond after Duncan Niederauer, the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, embarked on a goodwill tour, the purpose of which seemed to be to explain why the New York Stock Exchange had nothing to do with the flash crash.

      Every router, when it bought stock, tended to drive the price of that stock a bit higher. But when the stock had settled—say, ten seconds later—it settled differently with each router. The sequential costeffective router caused the share price to remain higher than the spray router did, and the spray router caused it to move higher than Thor did. “I have no scientific evidence,” said Brad. “This is purely a theory. But with Thor the HFT firms are trying to cover their losses. I’m short when I don’t want to be, so I need to buy to cover, quickly.” The other two routers enabled HFT to front-run, so they wound up being long the stock. “[With] the other two, HFT is in a position to trade around a winning position,” said Brad, “and they can do whatever they can do to force the stock even higher.” (Or lower, if the investor who triggered the activity is a seller.) They had, in those privileged microseconds, the reckless abandon of gamblers playing with house money.

      Lewis concludes that HFT is used as a method to front run orders placed by investors. He goes further to suggest that broad technological changes and unethical trading practices have transformed the U.S. stock market from "the world's most public, most democratic, financial market" into a "rigged" market.

      When companies that are equipped to do high-frequency trading receive that order, they (or their computers) recognize that a certain stock is about to be purchased in large quantities. So in the split-second before the order is filled they start buying up the stock. By "front running" the order, they can drive up the price of that stock, forcing the company placing the original order to pay more than they otherwise would have. The whole process is automated and takes just milliseconds, but do it enough times, with enough stock shares, over a long enough period, and it really starts to add up. 

      There are two ways of characterizing high frequency trading. In one, HFTs are front-running big investors, rigging the game against them and making the stock market illusory. In the other, HFTs are reacting instantly to demand, avoiding being picked off by informed investors and making the stock market more efficient.

      The role of the Puzzle Masters was to ensure that the new stock exchange did not contain aspects of a puzzle. That it had no problem inside its gears that could be “solved.” To begin, they listed the features of the existing stock exchanges and picked them apart. Aspects of the existing stock exchanges obviously incentivized bad behavior. Rebates, for instance: The maker-taker system of fees and kickbacks used by all of the exchanges was simply a method for paying the big Wall Street banks to screw the investors whose interests they were meant to guard. The rebates were the bait in the high-frequency traders’ flash traps. The moving parts of the traps were order types. Order types—like “market” and “limit”—exist so that the person who submits the order to buy or sell stock retains some control over his order after it has entered the marketplace. They are an acknowledgment that the investor cannot be physically present on the exchange to micromanage his situation. Order types also exist, less obviously, so that the person who is buying or selling stock can embed, in a single simple instruction, a lot of other, smaller instructions.

      A Hide Not Slide order—it was just one of maybe fifty such problems the Puzzle Masters solved— worked as follows: The trader said he was willing to buy the shares at a price ($80.03) above the current offering price ($80.02), but only if he was on the passive side of the trade, where he would be paid a rebate. He did this not because he wanted to buy the shares. He did this in case an actual buyer of stock—a real investor, channeling capital to productive enterprise—came along and bought all the shares offered at $80.02. The high-frequency trader’s Hide Not Slide order then established him as first in line to purchase P&G shares if a subsequent investor came into the market to sell those shares. This was the case even if the investor who had bought the shares at $80.02 expressed further demand for them at the higher price. A Hide Not Slide order was a way for a high-frequency trader to cut in line, ahead of the people who’d created the line in the first place, and take the kickbacks paid to whoever happened to be at the front of the line.

      The Puzzle Masters spent days working through the many order types. All of them had one thing in common: They were designed to create an edge for HFT at the expense of investors. “We’d always ask, ‘What is the point of that order, if you want to trade?’ ” said Brad. “Most of the order types were designed to not trade, or at least to discourage trading.

Aspects of the existing stock exchanges obviously incentivized bad behavior. Rebates, for instance: The maker-taker system of fees and kickbacks used by all of the exchanges was simply a method for paying the big Wall Street banks to screw the investors whose interests they were meant to guard. The rebates were the bait in the high-frequency traders’ flash traps. The moving parts of the traps were order types. Order types—like “market” and “limit”—exist so that the person who submits the order to buy or sell stock retains some control over his order after it has entered the marketplace. They are an acknowledgment that the investor cannot be physically present on the exchange to micromanage his situation. Order types also exist, less obviously, so that the person who is buying or selling stock can embed, in a single simple instruction, a lot of other, smaller instructions.

      A Hide Not Slide order—it was just one of maybe fifty such problems the Puzzle Masters solved— worked as follows: The trader said he was willing to buy the shares at a price ($80.03) above the current offering price ($80.02), but only if he was on the passive side of the trade, where he would be paid a rebate. He did this not because he wanted to buy the shares. He did this in case an actual buyer of stock—a real investor, channeling capital to productive enterprise—came along and bought all the shares offered at $80.02. The high-frequency trader’s Hide Not Slide order then established him as first in line to purchase P&G shares if a subsequent investor came into the market to sell those shares. This was the case even if the investor who had bought the shares at $80.02 expressed further demand for them at the higher price. A Hide Not Slide order was a way for a high-frequency trader to cut in line, ahead of the people who’d created the line in the first place, and take the kickbacks paid to whoever happened to be at the front of the line.

      The Puzzle Masters spent days working through the many order types. All of them had one thing in common: They were designed to create an edge for HFT at the expense of investors. “We’d always ask, ‘What is the point of that order, if you want to trade?’ ” said Brad. “Most of the order types were designed to not trade, or at least to discourage trading.

      Dark pools were another rogue spawn of the new financial marketplace. Private stock exchanges, run by the big brokers, they were not required to reveal to the public what happened inside them. They reported any trade they executed, but they did so with sufficient delay that it was impossible to know exactly what was happening in the broader market at the moment the trade occurred. Their internal rules were a mystery, and only the broker who ran a dark pool knew for sure whose buy and sell orders were allowed inside. The amazing idea the big Wall Street banks had sold to big investors was that transparency was their enemy. 

      He and his colleagues devised a test to see if there was anything in this new stock market to fear. The test, specifically, would show him if, when he entered an order into one of Wall Street’s dark pools, he wound up getting ripped off by some unseen predator. 

      As Gates traded in lightly traded stocks, and highfrequency trading firms were overwhelmingly interested in heavily traded ones, these tests would have been vastly more likely to generate false negatives than false positives. Still, he was a bit surprised that Goldman, and only Goldman, seemed to be running a pool that allowed someone else to front-run his orders to the public stock exchanges. He called his broker at Goldman. “He said it wasn’t fair,” said Gates, “because it wasn’t just them. He said, ‘It’s happening all over. It’s not just us.

      They wondered, shrewdly, exactly who was ripping off investors in Goldman’s dark pool. “They wanted to know if Goldman Sachs’s prop group was on the other side of the trade,” said Gates. He had no answer for that. “They don’t tell you who took the other side of the trade,” he said. All he knew was that he’d been ripped off, in exactly the way you might expect to be ripped off, when you can’t see the market trading in real time and others can.

      The Wall Street banks did not disclose which high-speed trading firms had paid them for special access to their dark pools, or how much they had paid, but selling that access was standard practice.

      Each Wall Street bank had its own detectable pattern for handling orders. The order was also slow, because of the time it was forced to spend inside the dark pool before accessing the wider market. As Brad had put it, “You could front-run an order in a dark pool on a bicycle.”

      The dark pool, Liquidnet, agreed to pay a $2 million dollar fine for illicitly sharing its customer order data. That's bad! One of the main market-structure conspiracy theories is that dark pools -- which are supposed to be places where institutions can go and post big orders without anyone ever seeing them -- are actually secretly selling institutional order flow to high-frequency traders. So catching a dark pool in the act is a pretty big story for the SEC.

      Liquidnet didn't share names, but who knows what the issuers could figure out from the "descriptive characteristics" that it did share.

      Liquidnet Holdings, a brokerage firm that operates a secretive trading venue, has agreed to pay a $2 million fine to settle accusations that it improperly used confidential information about its customers in marketing a new product, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.

      The brokerage firm, whose core trading platform is known as a dark pool, violated regulations as well as its own promises to members over a nearly three-year period when it allowed a separate business unit to access confidential data about the members’ trades, the S.E.C. said. 

      The agency said that Liquidnet neither admitted nor denied the findings. But Liquidnet’s chief executive, Seth Merrin, said in an interview that the firm acknowledged the problems after an S.E.C. audit two years ago and had since worked to fix them.

      On May 26 and 27, 1994 several national newspapers reported the findings of Christie and Schultz (1994) who cannot reject the hypothesis that market makers of active NASDAQ stocks implicitly colluded to maintain spreads of at least $0.25 by avoiding odd‐eighth quotes.

      The narrowing of quoted spreads has lead to a significant and real reduction in the costs that investors pay for market making services. We find that effective spreads, which measure investors' actual transaction costs by incorporating the location of the trade price relative to the bid-ask midpoint, decrease by more than 40 percent when quoted spreads fall. Although the effective spreads decline for all trade sizes, they fall most sharply for small trades.

      The decline in trading costs at the end of May 1994 is not explained by contemporaneous changes in the stocks' volatilities, prices, or trading volumes. Instead, our evidences suggests that spreads narrowed because an implicit agreement among market makers to maintain spreads of at least $0.25 was abandoned. Specifically, on May 26 and May 27, The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other newspaper reported the findings of Christie and Schultz (1994) that implicit agreements among market makers is the most likely explanation for the absence of odd-eighth quotes for active NASDAQ stocks. Coincidentally, dealers began to routinely quote Amgen, Cisco, and Microsoft in odd eights on May 27, and spreads collapsed as a result.

      The Commission's investigation followed allegations that raised serious questions about the integrity of both the Nasdaq market and the NASD's oversight of that market. Throughout 1993, the NASD's attempts to restrict use of its SOES system generated criticism that market makers were using the NASD's regulatory process to hamper legitimate competition. In the spring of 1994, a widely publicized economic study suggested that market makers implicitly colluded to maintain artificially wide inside spreads on Nasdaq by avoiding odd-eighth quotations in many stocks. Thereafter, several class action lawsuits alleging collusion were filed against Nasdaq market makers in the summer of 1994.

      The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation of the Nasdaq stock market, looking into allegations of price-fixing and other illegal practices by dealers in the nation’s busiest stock marketplace.

      “The antitrust division is looking at the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the over-the-counter stock market,” said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.

      The sources said the investigation appears to be in a preliminary phase. If the antitrust division decides to go forward with the case, it could bring either criminal price-fixing charges or civil antitrust charges.

      Questions have been raised this year about whether Nasdaq trading may be rigged against small investors. The Justice Department inquiry follows the May release of a study by two business school professors who said they found evidence of at least tacit collusion to fix investors’ trading costs among many of the 510 Nasdaq market makers.

      On the New York Stock Exchange, by contrast, spreads for most stocks are 1/8 of a point, or 12.5 cents, an NYSE spokeswoman said.

      The professors found that for 71 out of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks, market makers seemed never to quote prices in “odd eighths” of a point. In other words, bid or asked prices could be 20, 20 1/4, 20 1/2 or 20 3/4, but never 20 1/8, 20 3/8, 20 5/8 or 20 7/8--even though such quotes are common for other stocks.

      The direct result was that spreads in these stocks were never less than 1/4 of a point. And the wider spreads end up costing investors, in the aggregate, millions of dollars every year.

      Christie and Schulz concluded that the only possible explanation for the spreads was “tacit collusion” among market makers.

      Shortly after their report was made public, spreads for a few of the stocks they cited--including Apple, Microsoft and Thousand Oaks-based Amgen Inc.--suddenly narrowed to 1/8 of a point.

      The Department's investigation began in the summer of 1994, shortly after the publication of an economic study by Professors William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University about the Nasdaq market.

      The quoting convention imposes a penalty on Nasdaq market makers who want to narrow the "inside spread" in a stock. Because of this penalty--increased risk of trading the stock on the "wrong" side of the market--market makers had an incentive to avoid using eighth-point increments to update their stock quotes. The result has been that the inside spreads in a significant number of Nasdaq stocks have been wider than they would have been in a competitive market. This meant that investors were paying higher trading costs for buying and selling stocks on the Nasdaq market.

      The Department said that new traders were trained to update their price quotes in quarters for stocks with wide dealer spreads, and taught that quoting those stocks in eighths was unethical and unprofessional. The Department alleged that market makers used peer pressure to enforce the agreement. A market maker who deviated from the quoting convention might be told-- "You're spoiling it for everybody."

      The evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that Nasdaq market makers followed and in some cases overtly enforced a pricing convention that was used to determine the increments in which they would adjust their displayed quotes. This practice resulted in most stocks being quoted only in increments of $1/4.  Market makers testified that under the convention, stocks in which dealers were quoting spreads of $3/4 or more were to be quoted in even-eighths (i.e., $1/4, $1/2, $3/4), thereby giving rise to a minimum inside spread of $1/4 ("even-eighth stocks"). Stocks with dealer spreads less than $3/4 could be quoted in both even and odd-eighths, thereby allowing a minimum inside spread of $1/8. The dealer spread was understood by market makers as indicating which of the two quotation increments applied to a particular security The Nasdaq pricing convention was generally treated by market makers as a pricing "ethic," "tradition," or "professional norm" that other market makers were expected to follow, and was sometimes enforced through harassment, or threatened or actual refusals to deal. This pricing convention both directly and indirectly restricted the independent pricing decisions of individual market makers, and thereby negatively impacted price competition. Pricing and quoting decisions independently arrived at by individual market participants do not, in and of themselves, raise the same anticompetitive concerns.

      The existence of this pricing convention is confirmed through analysis of the price and quote data in the Nasdaq market. Prior to May 1994, more than 80% of all domestic Nasdaq NMS stocks (more than 3,200 stocks) followed the pricing convention. Of the more than 1,900 domestic NMS stocks greater than $10, more than 90% followed the pricing convention and approximately 78% were even-eighth stocks. Among the 100 most actively traded domestic Nasdaq stocks, at least 96% of them followed the convention and 66% of them had dealer spreads of $3/4 or greater.

      In January 2005, Gretchen Morgenson, the New York Times's ferociously anti-business business reporter, used her newspaper column to give Spitzer a facetious award: "To Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, for finding corruption in the third financial services industry in as many years. First it was Wall Street research, then the mutual fund industry. In 2004, it was the insurance business's turn."

      This particular Spitzer inquisition had an ending that might seem odd but is quite in keeping with Spitzer's policy of ending an inquisition with a virtue-cratic takeover of the industry. Using late-trading and market-timing favoritism as his legal and publicity bludgeon, Spitzer reached a settlement that included a pledge by mutual-fund operators to cut fees. Yes, cut fees. A professor of corporate law at the University of California, Los Angeles, Stephen Bainbridge, wrote, "It's as though you got busted for pot possession and the DA said you had to give up snowboarding." The Wall Street Journal agreed: "Spitzer's settlement…metes out a punishment that is unrelated to the crime." Even the SEC concurred: "This is a case about illegal market timing, not fees. Therefore, we see no legitimate basis for the Commission to act as a 'rate-setter' and determine how much mutual fund customers should pay for the services they receive in the future." Of course, from Spitzer's point of view, the settlement made perfect sense: What was immoral about the mutual funds' behavior was that they had discriminated against the little guy; and now they must (by cutting fees) do penance by making reparations to little guys—even if not to the same little guys they slighted.

      Eliot Spitzer became the attorney general of New York in 1999. In addition to carrying out the routine functions of that office, he has used a broad anti-fraud statute to conduct a series of aggressive and well-publicized campaigns against businesses, most notably in the financial industry. His purpose in these campaigns has not been the narrow one of punishing law-breakers.

      Wall Street Research. Acting on a hunch that Wall Street investment advice was biased, Spitzer used the Martin Act to demand innumerable e-mails from the firm of Merrill Lynch. On April 8, 2002, he issued a press release announcing that Merrill's analysts had "skewed" their stock ratings to win business for Merrill's investment-banking division and to punish firms that did not do business with it. The most damning of the e-mails were tossed to a mob of anti-capitalist reporters with predictable results. "Merrill Lynch Stox Shocker" screamed the New York Post. 

      The Mutual Funds. Spitzer's investigation of the mutual-fund industry showed the same pattern of using a few infractions to restructure an entire industry in accordance with the Spitzer morality. This investigation began with a tip that Canary Capital, a hedge fund run by Edward Julius Stern—heir to the Hartz Mountain pet-supply business—was engaged in market timing and late trading with several mutual funds.

      In his press release, Spitzer said: "In addition to steering business to its insurance company partners, Marsh, at times, solicited fake bids, which deceived its customers into thinking that true competition had taken place." Now, this is not the place to discuss bid rigging or the antitrust laws that forbid it. In any case, it is conceivable that Marsh may have owed an obligation to those seeking insurance not to engage in such acts.

He was then elected to two four-year terms as the Attorney General of New York, serving from 1999 to 2006; during this period, Spitzer became known as the "Sheriff of Wall Street" for his efforts to curb corruption in the financial services industry.

      Long before there was Barack Obama there was Spitzer. While Obama toiled unknown in Illinois, the Bronx-born Spitzer won himself a national reputation as the "Sheriff of Wall Street". He was New York's tough-talking attorney-general, who fought banking corruption, enforced environment law and won rights for low-paid workers. He used that fame to enter politics and in 2006 became governor of New York: a perfect springboard for the White House.

        Hedge funds, banks, and insurance companies caused the subprime mortgage crisis. Hedge funds and banks created mortgage-backed securities. The insurance companies covered them with credit default swaps. Demand for mortgages led to an asset bubble in housing.

        Hedge funds are always under tremendous pressure to outperform the market. They created demand for mortgage-backed securities by pairing them with guarantees called credit default swaps. What could go wrong? Nothing, until the Fed started raising interest rates. Those with adjustable-rate mortgages couldn't make these higher payments. Demand fell, and so did housing prices. When they couldn't sell their homes, either, they defaulted. No one could price, or sell, the now-worthless securities. And American International Group (AIG) almost went bankrupt trying to cover the insurance.

        AIG had become a major seller of credit default swaps in an attempt to boost its profit margin. These swaps insured the assets that supported corporate debt and mortgages. If AIG went bankrupt, it would trigger the bankruptcy of many of the financial institutions that had bought these swaps.

        AIG's swaps on subprime mortgages pushed the otherwise profitable company to the brink of bankruptcy. As the mortgages tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to raise millions in capital. As stockholders got wind of the situation, they sold their shares, making it even more difficult for AIG to cover the swaps.

        Even though AIG had more than enough assets to cover the swaps, it couldn't sell them before the swaps came due. It left it without the cash to pay the swap insurance.

        On September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve provided an $85 billion two-year loan to AIG to prevent its bankruptcy and further stress on the global economy.

        In return, the Fed took ownership of 79.9 percent of AIG's equity. 

        In October 2008, the Fed hired Edward Liddy as CEO and Chairman. His job was to break up AIG and sell off the pieces to repay the loan. Liddy had to safely unwind billions in credit default swaps. He used $62 billion of the Fed's loan.

        On October 8, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York agreed to lend $37.8 billion to AIG subsidiaries in exchange for fixed-income securities.

        In April 2009, the Treasury committed another $29.84 billion to AIG. These changes made the total bailout package $182 billion.

        AIG collapsed because collateral obligations embedded in the CDSs it wrote triggered a chain reaction that drained it of cash. Unable to raise funds in the private markets or quickly sell off some of its trillion dollars in assets, AIG was forced to accept a government bailout. In hindsight, it is easy to conclude that AIG should have never gotten into the CDS business, or at least not written the $61.4 billion of CDSs on multi-sector CDOs with subprime mortgage loan exposure. Ultimately, however, AIG took a calculated business risk that turned out disastrous.

        In the wake of the bailouts of Bear Steams, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae, and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the government determined that the financial markets were too fragile to absorb an AIG bankruptcy. Thus, it rescued AIG with a package that soon grew to over $182.5 billion.

        As Elizabeth Warren’s devastating Congressional report reveals, the Federal Reserve used taxpayer money to bail out the insurance giant, instead of forcing the major banks to clean up the mess they helped create.

        The government’s $182 billion bailout of insurance giant AIG should be seen as the Rosetta Stone for understanding the financial crisis and its costly aftermath.

        “The AIG rescue demonstrated that Treasury and the Federal Reserve would commit taxpayers to pay any price and bear any burden to prevent the collapse of America’s largest financial institutions,” the COP report said. This could have been avoided, the report argues, if the Fed had listened to disinterested advisers with a less parochial understanding of the public interest.

        This agency MBS program is managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The New York Fed will continue to work with two investment managers to support the implementation of the program.

        The FOMC directed the Desk to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS. Actual purchases by the program effectively reached this target. The purchase activity began on January 5, 2009 and continued through March 31, 2010.

        The Federal Reserve essentially tried to drive longer-term interest rates lower by withdrawing supply from the fixed-rate financial asset markets and forcing investors to overcome their risk aversion and rebalance their portfolios. One might argue that $1.25 trillion in MBS would be too small to have this affect in a normal environment because there are over $23 trillion of fixed-rate, high-quality, dollar-denominated financial assets. However, the financial crisis called into question the validity of credit ratings for fixed-rated assets and increased the demand for “full faith and credit” government-backed securities. As a result, the $1.25 trillion dollar withdrawal of MBS was a much larger fraction of the relevant market as far as risk-averse investors were concerned. Thus, the “portfolio balance effect” might be greater during period of financial crisis because of investors’ views of acceptable substitutions for government-backed assets are much more limited.

        Initially intended to purchase up to $500 billion in MBS's, this limit was increased in March 2009 to $1.25 trillion, where it has remained ever since. Private markets must now sustain such purchases of MBS's for housing markets to remain stable, and many Fed officials and industry analysts seem to believe that they are.

        But this is only the second phase of the Fed's exit strategy from MBS's -- the first being announcements of a March 31st end to the program. With over a trillion worth in MBS's on the balance sheet, the Fed will have to develop a strategy for eventually selling these assets. This, however, must occur within the government's broader efforts to restructure and account for Fannie and Freddie.

        Now I found myself explaining to the president why the Federal Reserve was planning to lend $85 billion to American International Group (AIG), the world’s largest insurance company. The company had gambled recklessly, using exotic financial instruments to insure securities backed by subprime mortgages.

        With more than $1 trillion in assets, AIG was more than 50 percent larger than Lehman. It operated in more than 130 countries and had more than 74 million individual and corporate customers worldwide. It provided commercial insurance to 180,000 small businesses and other corporate entities employing 106 million people—two-thirds of American workers. Its insurance products protected municipalities, pension funds, and participants in 401(k) retirement plans. AIG’s collapse could well trigger the failures of yet more financial giants, both in the United States and abroad.

        Without doubt, the risks we would be taking were huge. Though $85 billion was an enormous sum, much more was at stake than money. If AIG failed even with the loan, the financial panic would intensify, and market confidence in the Fed’s ability to control the crisis could be destroyed. Moreover, the future of the Fed itself could be at risk.

        The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported in January 2011 that CDS contributed significantly to the crisis. Companies were able to sell protection to investors against the default of mortgage-backed securities, helping to launch and expand the market for new, complex instruments such as CDO's. This further fueled the housing bubble. They also amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread these bets throughout the financial system. Companies selling protection, such as AIG, were not required to set aside sufficient capital to cover their obligations when significant defaults occurred. Because many CDS were not traded on exchanges, the obligations of key financial institutions became hard to measure, creating uncertainty in the financial system.

        OTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways. First, one type of derivative—credit default swaps (CDS)—fueled the mortgage securitization pipeline. CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage-related securities backed by risky loans. Companies sold protection—to the tune of $79 billion, in AIG’s case—to investors in these newfangled mortgage securities, helping to launch and expand the market and, in turn, to further fuel the housing bubble.

      At least one study has suggested that the decline in standards was driven by a shift of mortgage securitization from a tightly controlled duopoly to a competitive market in which mortgage originators held the most sway.The worst mortgage vintage years coincided with the periods during which Government Sponsored Enterprises (specifically Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) were at their weakest, and mortgage originators and private label securitizers were at their strongest.

      The boom in mortgage lending, including subprime lending, was also driven by a fast expansion of non-bank independent mortgage originators which despite their smaller share (around 25 percent in 2002) in the market have contributed to around 50 percent of the increase in mortgage credit between 2003 and 2005. In the third quarter of 2007, subprime ARMs making up only 6.9% of US mortgages outstanding also accounted for 43% of the foreclosures which began during that quarter.

      Most of the blame is on the mortgage originators or the lenders. That's because they were responsible for creating these problems. After all, the lenders were the ones who advanced loans to people with poor credit and a high risk of default.

      At the time, lenders probably saw subprime mortgages as less of a risk than they really were—rates were low, the economy was healthy, and people were making their payments.

      Mortgage underwriting standards declined precipitously during the boom period. The use of automated loan approvals allowed loans to be made without appropriate review and documentation. In 2007, 40% of all subprime loans resulted from automated underwriting. The chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association claimed that mortgage brokers, while profiting from the home loan boom, did not do enough to examine whether borrowers could repay. Mortgage fraud by lenders and borrowers increased enormously.

      From 2000 to 2007, one of the largest agencies – Moody's – rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities – more than half of those it rated – as triple-A. By December 2008, there were over $11 trillion structured finance securities outstanding in the U.S. bond market debt. But as the boom matured, mortgage underwriting standards deteriorated. By 2007 an estimated $3.2 in loans were made to homebuyers and owners with bad credit and undocumented incomes, bundled into MBSs and CDOs, and given top ratings to appeal to global investors.

      Bair was the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — the regulator-in-chief across our entire national banking system. In 2008, there were 25 banks that Bair’s own agency had to take over owing to insolvency. One of the banks, Washington Mutual, had over $300 billion of assets. Another, Indymac, had a not-insignificant $30 billion of assets. The other 23 of 25 bank failures were tiny banks, some with as little as $19 million in assets. Another 140 banks failed under Bair’s watch in 2009. Again, in no case were these big or sophisticated banks — they were regional, small, and often community banks. Bair need not play the role of outsider studying the data — she was an insider who made the data — to know that the bank failures of the financial crisis were not sophisticated banks hurting working families. Working families were hurting non-sophisticated banks, and Sheila Bair knows it.

      The regulations of the Warren-CFPB era have been successful at slamming community banks, encouraging low-quality underwriting in their credit-card businesses, and pushing a massive amount of increased market share on to the top four banks in the country. And if someone tells me these things happened against Warren’s wishes, as unintended consequences of her abysmal policy platform, I would be happy to believe them. But the facts are clear as can be here: The Dodd-Frank, Warren-CFPB regime was a huge success in promoting bureaucracy, codifying “too big to fail,” and damaging small banks. It was a disaster for creating, as Bair claims, a market-based financial system.

      Investment Banks Worsen the Situation

      The increased use of the secondary mortgage market by lenders added to the number of subprime loans lenders could originate. Instead of holding the originated mortgages on their books, lenders were able to simply sell off the mortgages in the secondary market and collect the originating fees. This freed up more capital for even more lending, which increased liquidity even more, and the snowball began to build.

      A lot of the demand for these mortgages came from the creation of assets pooling mortgages together into a security, such as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). In this process, investment banks would buy the mortgages from lenders and securitize them into bonds, which were sold to investors through CDOs.

      The subprime mortgage crisis, which guided us into the Great Recession, has many parties that can share blame for it. For one, lenders were selling these as mortgage-backed securities. After the lenders approved and gave out the loan, that loan would be sold to an investment bank. The investment bank would then bundle this mortgage with other similar mortgage for other parties to invest in, and the lender would, as a result of the sale, have more money to use for home loans.

      Lenders were far too ready to give away so many risky loans at once, seemingly assuming that housing prices would continue to rise and interest rates would stay low. Investment banks seem to have had similar motives, getting bolder with their mortgage-backed securities investments.

      Though these parties decidedly took advantage of people with bad credit in need of a place to live, homebuyers and the distinctly American pursuit of owning a home played a small role in this as well. The dream of upward mobility and owning larger homes led people to be riskier with their own real estate investments, and predatory lenders were all too ready to help them.

      Conflicts of interest were largely responsible for the disastrous performance of credit rating agencies in assessing the risks of mortgage-backed securities, two former high-ranking officials at Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s said Wednesday in Congressional testimony.

      The securities issuers pay the agencies to issue ratings, and the agencies’ interests can eclipse those of investors, Jerome S. Fons, who was the managing director for credit policy at Moody’s until 2007, told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

      “While the methods used to rate structured securities have rightly come under fire, in my opinion the business model prevented analysts from putting investor interests first,” he said.

      And Frank L. Raiter, who was the head of mortgage ratings at Standard & Poor’s for 10 years, characterized the failures at that company by saying simply: “Profits were running the show.”

      “The story of the credit rating agencies is a story of colossal failure,” Mr. Waxman said. “The credit rating agencies occupy a special place in our financial markets. Millions of investors rely on them for independent, objective assessments. The rating agencies broke this bond of trust, and federal regulators ignored the warning signs and did nothing to protect the public.”

      The pools of debt the agencies gave their highest ratings to included over three trillion dollars of loans to homebuyers with bad credit and undocumented incomes through 2007. Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of these triple-A securities were downgraded to "junk" status by 2010, and the writedowns and losses came to over half a trillion dollars. This led "to the collapse or disappearance" in 2008–09 of three major investment banks (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch), and the federal governments buying of $700 billion of bad debt from distressed financial institutions.

      Credit rating agencies came under scrutiny following the mortgage crisis for giving investment-grade, "money safe" ratings to securitized mortgages (in the form of securities known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO)) based on "non-prime"—subprime or Alt-A—mortgages loans.

      Credit rating agencies – firms which rate debt instruments/securities according to the debtor's ability to pay lenders back – have come under scrutiny during and after the financial crisis for having given investment-grade ratings to MBSs and CDOs based on risky subprime mortgage loans that later defaulted. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by investors against the "Big Three" rating agencies – Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch Ratings. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) concluded the "failures" of the Big Three rating agencies were "essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction" and "key enablers of the financial meltdown". Economist Joseph Stiglitz called them "one of the key culprits" of the financial crisis. Others called their ratings "catastrophically misleading", (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner), their performance "horrendous" (The Economist magazine). There are indications that some involved in rating subprime-related securities knew at the time that the rating process was faulty.

      The putatively independent parties meanwhile were paid "handsome fees" by investment banks "to obtain the desired ratings", according to one expert.

      From 2000 to 2007, one of the largest agencies – Moody's – rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities – more than half of those it rated – as triple-A. By December 2008, there were over $11 structured finance securities outstanding in the U.S. bond market debt. But as the boom matured, mortgage underwriting standards deteriorated. By 2007 an estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homebuyers and owners with bad credit and undocumented incomes, bundled into MBSs and CDOs, and given top ratings to appeal to global investors.

       As these mortgages began to default, the three agencies were compelled to go back and redo their ratings. Between autumn of 2007 and the middle of 2008, agencies downgraded nearly $2 trillion in MBS tranches. By the end of 2008, 80% of the CDOs by value rated "triple-A" were downgraded to junk. Bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion.

       The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown. The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.

      And you will see that without the active participation of the rating agencies, the market for mortgage-related securities could not have been what it became.

      The high ratings erroneously given CDOs by credit rating agencies encouraged investors and financial institutions to purchase them and enabled the continuing securitization of nonprime mortgages. There was a clear failure of corporate governance at Moody’s, which did not ensure the quality of its ratings on tens of thousands of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs.

      The bankruptcy of the FSLIC did not occur overnight; the FSLIC was a disaster waiting to happen for many years.

      An incomplete and bungled deregulation of S&Ls in 1980 and 1982 lifted restrictions on the kinds of investments S&Ls could make. In 1980 and again in 1982, Congress and the regulators granted S&Ls the power to invest directly in service corporations, permitted them to make real estate loans without regard to the geographical location of the loan, and authorized them to hold up to 40 percent of their assets as commercial real estate loans. Congress and the Reagan administration naïvely hoped that if S&Ls made higher-yielding, but riskier, investments, they would make more money to offset the long-term damage caused by fixed-rate mortgages. However, the 1980 and 1982 legislation did not change how premiums were set for federal deposit insurance. Riskier S&Ls still were not charged higher rates for deposit insurance than their pruden t siblings. As a result, deregulation encouraged increased risk taking by S&Ls.

      The FHLBB also permitted excessive lending to any one borrower. These powers encouraged unscrupulous real estate developers and others who were unfamiliar with the banking business to acquire and then rapidly grow their S&Ls into insolvency.

      A large number of S&L customers' defaults and bankruptcies ensued, and the S&Ls that had overextended themselves were forced into insolvency proceedings themselves.

      Initially successful with annualized return of over 21% (after fees) in its first year, 43% in the second year and 41% in the third year, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months due to a combination of high leverage and exposure to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis.

      As LTCM teetered, Wall Street feared that Long-Term's failure could cause a chain reaction in numerous markets, causing catastrophic losses throughout the financial system.

      After LTCM failed to raise more money on its own, it became clear it was running out of options. On September 23, 1998, Goldman Sachs, AIG, and Berkshire Hathaway offered then to buy out the fund's partners for $250 million, to inject $3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman's own trading division. The offer of $250 million was stunningly low to LTCM's partners because at the start of the year their firm had been worth $4.7 billion. Warren Buffett gave Meriwether less than one hour to accept the deal; the time lapsed before a deal could be worked out.

      Seeing no options left, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of $3.625 billion by the major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets.

      Like many hedge funds, LTCM's investment strategies were based upon hedging against a predictable range of volatility in foreign currencies and bonds. On August 17, 1998, Russia declared it was devaluing its currency. It also defaulted on its bonds. That event was beyond the normal range that LTCM had estimated. By August 31, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped by 13%. Investors sought refuge in Treasury bonds, causing long-term interest rates to fall by more than a full point by September 30, 1998.﻿

      As a result, LTCM's highly leveraged investments started to crumble. By the end of August 1998, it lost 50% of the value of its capital investments. Since so many banks and pension funds had invested in LTCM, its problems threatened to push most of them to near bankruptcy.

      In September, Bear Stearns dealt the deathblow.﻿ The investment bank managed all of LTCM's bond and derivatives settlements. It called in a $500 million payment. Bear Stearns was afraid it would lose all its considerable investments. LTCM had been out of compliance with its banking agreements for three months.

      To save the U.S. banking system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William McDonough convinced 14 banks to bail out LTCM. They spent $3.5 billion in return for a 90% ownership of the fund.

      Due to Long Term Capital Management’s highly leveraged nature, coupled with a financial crisis in Russia (i.e., the default of government bonds), LTCM sustained massive losses and was in danger of defaulting on its own loans. This made it difficult for LTCM to cut its losses in its positions. LTCM held huge positions, totaling roughly 5% of the total global fixed-income market, and had borrowed massive amounts of money to finance these leveraged trades.

      In September 1998, the fund, which continued to sustain losses, was bailed out with the help of the Federal Reserve. Then its creditors took over, and a systematic meltdown of the market was prevented.

      In only a few weeks, Long-Term was facing $1 trillion in default risks. Meriwether tried to raise more money from investors to save their positions, but no one was willing to lend.

      If Long-Term went bankrupt, the entirety of Wall Street was facing exposure and huge losses. Finally, the Federal Reserve worked together with Wall Street's major banks to put together a $3.65 billion bailout package.

      The scandal sowed distrust in the financial industry and led to a wave of fines, lawsuits, and regulatory actions. Although the scandal came to light in 2012, there is evidence suggesting that the collusion in question had been ongoing since as early as 2003. 

      The scheme caused financial contracts to be mispriced throughout the world, in transactions such as mortgages, corporate fundraising, and derivative trades.

      Although it is difficult to know whether any particular person was affected by the LIBOR scandal, there are many potential ways in which its impact could have been felt. For example, individual homeowners may have initiated fixed-rate mortgages at a time when mortgage rates were artificially lifted based on upward manipulation of the LIBOR. From the homeowner’s perspective, every dollar of additional expense caused by the artificially high rates could be seen as a kind of “theft” being committed by the LIBOR rate fixers. Similarly, many traders who were party to derivative contracts would have experienced unnecessarily severe losses as a result of the LIBOR scandal.

      The scandal arose when it was discovered that banks were falsely inflating or deflating their rates so as to profit from trades, or to give the impression that they were more creditworthy than they were. Libor underpins approximately $350 trillion in derivatives. 

      The banks are supposed to submit the actual interest rates they are paying, or would expect to pay, for borrowing from other banks. The Libor is supposed to be the total assessment of the health of the financial system because if the banks being polled feel confident about the state of things, they report a low number and if the member banks feel a low degree of confidence in the financial system, they report a higher interest rate number. In June 2012, multiple criminal settlements by Barclays Bank revealed significant fraud and collusion by member banks connected to the rate submissions, leading to the scandal.

      On 27 July 2012, the Financial Times published an article by a former trader which stated that Libor manipulation had been common since at least 1991.

      Timothy Lee, a capital markets expert at the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General, said in a 3 November memo that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have lost more than $3 billion because of the manipulation.

      Before the financial crisis, states and localities bought $500 billion in interest rate swaps to hedge their municipal bond sales. It is estimated that the manipulation of Libor cost municipalities at least $6 billion. These losses were in addition to $4 billion that localities had already paid to unwind backfiring interest rate swaps.

      The moves amount to the strongest and clearest guidance yet from regulators about the risks to banks for writing new contracts based on Libor, an interest-rate benchmark that global policy makers moved to scrap after concluding it was balky and prone to manipulation.

      Deeply rooted in markets, Libor was exposed by a 2012 scandal that led to convictions for some traders and penalties for numerous banks.

      If the transition doesn't go as planned, consumers could end up on the hook for increased payments on credit-card loans and other borrowings, while small businesses could face higher fixed rates for loans.

      Three former Barclays BARC.L traders have been found guilty by a London jury of conspiring to fraudulently manipulate global benchmark interest rates in a stark warning to junior bankers and a major victory for Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

      The verdicts bring to five the number of people convicted in London for being part of a global financial conspiracy that has forced banks to pay fines of $9 billion, discredited rates like Libor and helped shred public faith in the banking industry.

      “The trial in this country of American nationals also demonstrates the extent to which the response to Libor manipulation has been international and the subject of extensive cooperation between U.S. and UK authorities.”

      Fraud trial was second in U.S. stemming from 2008 benchmark-rate manipulation.

      Two former Deutsche Bank traders were found guilty of trying to rig a key lending benchmark that was considered one of the most important barometers of the world’s financial health.

      Matthew Connolly, who led Deutsche Bank’s pool trading desk in New York, and Gavin Campbell Black, a former derivatives trader who worked on the bank’s London desk, were convicted Wednesday of conspiracy and wire fraud charges following a monthlong trial in Manhattan federal court.

      The German bank in 2015 agreed to pay $2.5bn in penalties to resolve related charges in the US and the UK and a unit in London pleaded guilty in the US to one count of wire fraud.

      Its integrity was called into question following a rate-rigging scandal where traders at numerous banks were able to nudge it up or down by submitting false data. Banks were fined billions of dollars and several traders were sent to jail.

      Hayes, a 36-year-old former UBS and Citigroup trader, was in August found unanimously guilty of eight charges of conspiracy to defraud for rigging Libor, the London interbank offered rate, that underpins around $450 trillion of financial contracts and consumer loans worldwide.

      Cast as the ringleader in one of the rate-rigging scams that has cost banks billions in regulatory fines, Hayes was found guilty of conspiring to rig Libor for profit.

      While LIBOR has been a long-established global benchmark standard for interest rate, it has had its fair share of controversies including a major scandal of rate rigging. Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate the LIBOR rates. They took traders' requests into account and submitted artificially low LIBOR rates to keep them at their preferred levels. The intention behind the alleged malpractice was to bump up traders’ profits who were holding positions in LIBOR-based financial securities.

      Following reporting by the Wall Street Journal in 2008, major global banks, which were on the panels and contributed to the LIBOR determination process, faced regulatory scrutiny. It involved investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. Similar investigations were launched in other parts of the globe including in the U.K. and Europe. Major banks and financial institutions including Barclays, ICAP, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Deutsche Bank faced heavy fines. Punitive actions were also taken on their employees who were found to be involved in the malpractice. The scandal was also one of the primary reasons why LIBOR shifted from BBA administration to ICE.

      Beginning in 2012, an international investigation into the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, revealed a widespread plot by multiple banks—notably Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS, Rabobank, and the Royal Bank of Scotland—to manipulate these interest rates for profit starting as far back as 2003. Investigations continue to implicate major institutions, exposing them to lawsuits and shaking trust in the global financial system.

      Regulators in the United States, the UK, and the European Union have fined banks more than $9 billion for rigging Libor, which underpins over $300 trillion worth of loans worldwide.
