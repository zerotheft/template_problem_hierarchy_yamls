# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.

describe_problem_area: |
  U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.

  Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.

A recent ruling by the European Commission, which is under appeal, found that Apple used this tax haven structure in Ireland to pay a rate of just 0.005 percent on its European profits in 2014, and has required that the company pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland".

    description: |
      It was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before a United States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel’s chairman called “ghost companies.”

      Five months after Mr. Cook’s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.

      Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.      

      Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company’s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.

      "Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

    description: |
      It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens. The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.

      Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures has helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation.

      The fortunes of the superrich are growing more quickly than the wealth of everyone else, thanks in part to offshore companies the elite use to minimize their taxes. Queen Elizabeth II, Madonna and Bono have all taken advantage of such companies, the documents reveal. Americans are big customers: The hedge fund billionaire James H. Simons and his family were beneficiaries of a massive trust in Bermuda. And Warren A. Stephens, who aggressively grew a family investment bank in Arkansas, used an opaque company to hide his stake in a payday loan business accused of exploiting the poor.

      Big companies have long relied on strategies to reduce their tax bills. But the new tax law is making it even easier, with a new analysis finding that 60 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no taxes on a total of $79 billion of profits earned in 2018.

      The companies, which include tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix, should have paid a collective $16.4 billion in federal income taxes based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's 21 percent corporate tax rate, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Instead, these corporations received a net tax rebate of $4.3 billion. The analysis is based on the corporations' annual financial reports, which were filed earlier this year to report their 2018 results. 

      Defenders of the corporate cuts under the tax law that took effect this year, which lowered the rate companies pay to 21 percent from from 35 percent, contend they will plump profits, drive investment and boost economic growth.

But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.

      The wealthiest people are among the biggest tax evaders, according to a June 2019 paper in the American Economic Review. The authors — Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman — analyzed 685 records from Norway, Sweden and Denmark exposed following the Panama Papers and Swiss Leaks investigations, along with tax amnesty data from 1,422 households in Norway and 6,811 in Sweden.

      They find the wealthiest 0.01% of asset holders — who own half the wealth in the sample — evade 25% of their tax liability, compared with 5% across the entire sample. Some 35% of the top 0.5% richest households in the distribution engaged in tax evasion. “The most important insight is that government policies have a critical role to play to reduce tax evasion,” the authors write. “Increasing penalties for tax evaders has not proved to be a very practical way to curb tax cheating so far.” Tax evasion is also rampant among the self-employed, according to U.S. government analyses. As the authors of the AEA paper note, the likelihood of self-employment rises as wealth increases. In instances where there is no third-party reporting — like an employer submitting employee wage information to the federal government — the noncompliance rate is 63%, according to IRS research. Misreporting is only at 1% when income amounts are subject to substantial information reporting and withholding. The IRS calls this “visibility.” Income that self-employed people earn is less “visible” than income earned by someone who works for a company or nonprofit, both of which would report wage information to the IRS every year. Business income made up the biggest chunk — $125 billion — of all underreported individual income, according to the Government Accountability Office report.

      Microsoft had shifted at least $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico, where the company’s tax consultants, KPMG, had persuaded the territory’s government to give Microsoft a tax rate of nearly 0%. Microsoft had justified this transfer with a ludicrous-sounding deal: It had sold its most valuable possession — its intellectual property — to an 85-person factory it owned in a small Puerto Rican city. Over years of work, the IRS uncovered evidence that it believed laid the scheme bare. In one document, a Microsoft senior executive celebrated the company’s “pure tax play.” In another, KPMG plotted how to make the company Microsoft created to own the Puerto Rico factory — and a portion of Microsoft’s profits — seem real.

      Microsoft fought back with every tool it could muster. Business organizations, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to tech trade groups, rallied, hiring attorneys to jump into the fray on Microsoft’s side in court and making their case to IRS leadership and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Soon, members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, were decrying the IRS’ tactics and introducing legislation to stop the IRS from ever taking similar steps again.
