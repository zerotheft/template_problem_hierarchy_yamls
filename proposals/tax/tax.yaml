# The following summary is not an exact amount, but an opinion on an approximation
# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

      "Average workers in the United States face two major taxes on wage income: the individual income tax and the payroll tax (levied on both the employee and the employer).

      Although slightly more than half of a U.S. worker’s payroll tax burden is paid by their employer, the worker ultimately pays this tax through lower take-home pay. Before accounting for state and local sales taxes, the U.S. tax wedge—the tax burden that a single average wage earner faces—was 29.8 percent of pretax earnings in 2019, adding up to $18,368 in taxes."

      Warren Buffett may be right when he says that high-income taxpayers could pay more, especially given the extremely rapid rate of income growth at the top of the distribution. And he’s certainly correct when he says that the low tax rate on investment income cuts his tax bill well below that of many Americans. But he’s off base when he suggests that all high-income taxpayers pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than their middle-income coworkers."

      Advocates say a wealth tax would dilute the largest fortunes in the U.S. and restrain the emergence of a plutocracy. It could encourage the wealthy to dissipate their fortunes by spending the money, giving it to charity, or giving it to their children to avoid the tax. But even so it would still raise a lot of money. Saez and Zucman say Warren’s tax would yield $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Critics, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, say that’s a substantial overestimate.

    url: "https://www.propublica.org/article/trumps-company-paid-bribes-to-reduce-property-taxes-assessors-say"
    description: |
      The Trump Organization paid bribes, through middlemen, to New York City tax assessors to lower its property tax bills for several Manhattan buildings in the 1980s and 1990s, according to five former tax assessors and city employees as well as a former Trump Organization employee.

      Two of the five city employees said they personally took bribes to lower the assessment on a Trump property; the other three said they had indirect knowledge of the payments.

      The city employees were among 18 indicted in 2002 for taking bribes in exchange for lowering the valuations of properties, which in turn reduced the taxes owed for the buildings. All of the 18 eventually pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan except for one, who died before his case was resolved.

      The assessors each pleaded guilty and most of them served between one to three years in prison. The Finance Department said that they had deprived the city of $160 million in tax revenue over the four years prior to the indictments and millions more in the decades before that. They are still paying restitution.

      Amazon also decimates local budgets through its effect on traditional retail. A 2015 analysis found that Amazon sales displaced retail outlets that would have paid $528 million in property taxes. And that’s before getting into the specific tax benefits given to Amazon, which usually come in the form of property tax reductions.

      Amazon entities that own Seattle property are the largest and fifth-largest individual property tax payers in the city, according to government filings. At the regular rate applicable to the company’s home base in South Lake Union, that would yield a tax bill of roughly $27 million. The company also directly pays state and city business and occupation taxes, which tax the portion of Amazon’s sales attributable to in-state customers. Those revenue totals are unclear.

      Meanwhile, Amazon has taken advantage of a state sales and use tax break aimed at high-tech firms as it built out its $4 billion corporate campus. The company deferred a cumulative $54 million in taxes under the program.

Those credits will remain on the books. Between 2013 and 2018, aerospace employers in Washington claimed an average $116.1 million in annual savings from the preferential B&O tax rate, with Boeing taking the lion’s share each year.

      Walmart is one of a number of companies that have implemented a full-court press effort to reduce its property taxes nationwide.

      This strategy works for the corporate giants because many local taxing jurisdictions simply don’t have the financial resources to match up against corporate legal teams in court, and often find it cheaper to simply give in to corporate tax-cutting demands

      The Walton family fortune grew by $39 billion in the last year, according to Bloomberg. The rate at which the family’s wealth grew each day—$100 million—is equal to the property taxes Walmart is, by one estimate, seeking to avoid paying in Arkansas.

      While Democrats are proposing business tax hikes, a Republican plan would give many of Washington’s largest corporations a sizable property tax cut.

      Those breaks would include a $7.4 million annual reduction for Boeing, a $6 million cut for Puget Sound Energy and a $1.8 million break for Alaska Airlines, according to new estimates from the state Department of Revenue.

      Microsoft had shifted at least $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico, where the company’s tax consultants, KPMG, had persuaded the territory’s government to give Microsoft a tax rate of nearly 0%. Microsoft had justified this transfer with a ludicrous-sounding deal: It had sold its most valuable possession — its intellectual property — to an 85-person factory it owned in a small Puerto Rican city.

      The concept was simple. A U.S. company sold its most valuable asset — for a tech company, its intellectual property — to a subsidiary in a place (Ireland, Singapore, Puerto Rico, etc.) where the tax rate was extremely low.
