# The following summary is not an exact amount, but an opinion on an approximation
# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosecution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

describe_problem_area: |
  The US constitution and founding fathers made our country so all men & women are equal. This means there must not be a priviliged class.  

  The theft happens by this reasoning:
  a) A worker has a good job and a salary of $500,000 per year. Their tax rate is often 51% to 59% with federal and local taxes. They often have $250k or less after taxes.
  b) An investor who makes $500,000 every year in investor gains pays a lower 10% to 20% taxes. This is magnified with deferred taxes with schemes like share-buy-back, etc.  They often keep $450k to $400k after taxes.

  Your vote and decision if the tax rates are wrong and cause theft. Does congress sell out and work for the wealthy and corporations to rig the economy? Do the make they investor class a privilege class over workers.

  This problem becomes a large scale massive problem when Investor taxes (Capital gains) are set far to low. Billionaires have most of their wealth in investments, so the financial damage of their taxes set unethically low shifts the costs of the government to workers with exceptionally high taxes, on people who are struggling to get by.

# {~C~} The following are questions you may want to answer in building your case. {~C~}
# {~C~} Your reasoning should provide a strong case for how the economy is being rigged against citizens. {~C~}
# {~C~} These are just examples and ideas to get you started.  You should delete them and build your own arguments. {~C~}
reasoning: |
  1) Are credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations are doing unethical tax evasion (by any term)?: And those companies and executives were never convicted of tax evasion related crimes?{You the citizen will vote}
  2) If a US citizen (commoner) works in the USA, lives in the USA but had their paycheck depositedd into their off-shore bank. If they then never paid taxes, they would be put in jail.  If US companies do the same (put their profits or revenue offshore) - when they are USA company or the revenue was generated in the USA, does the government charge them with a crime? And convict them? If not, then the government sells out.  {Needs research and debate}
  3) Do you consider it THEFT if corporations do tax evasion by moving profits offshore and not paying taxes? (Especially if citizens are put in jail if they did it with their salarys)
  4) Does the USA put commoners in jail when they do tax evasion: {Needs research and debate}
  5) Are credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations carry out tricks to move profits or revenue to offshore entities for the purpose of tax evasion? 
  6) Do you consider it a crime of THEFT if corporations carry out tricks to do tax evasion (or instead something you consider on nethically not paying taxes)? Especially if a USA worker would go to jail if they did the same with not paying taxes on their salary?
  7) If a USA worker lived in the US, worked in the US, but had a bank account in Ireland.  If they had their employer auto-deposited their paycheck to their Ireland bank, they would be put in jail for tax exavsion when they didn't pay taxes. Ethically, this is the tax evasion corporations carry out (after looking past their excuses). The decision for the voter is it theft then corporations do the kind
    of tax behavior that would send a USA worker to jail if they did it.
  8) One ethical test if congress is selling out to corporations and the wealthy to steal by a rigged economy is to compare the Taxes paid by workers vs Taxes paid by Investors (Capital Gains) in the past.  If an ethical congress several decades ago set it ethically, but ore recently congress sold, out then this is easier to detect.    
    The following is for a worker with a salary of $500k/year vs an Invetor with $500k/year in Capital Gains.
    States make things complicated so this will just illustrate in one sample state, ~~~~FFF~~~~.  2019 Capital Gain Tax rate: n%     SOURCE
  9) USA workers/citizens pay 88.9% of US Gov taxes.  Capital Gains (tax on individual investors) is n%.  This is even worse when large corporations are the one that can do tax evasions so the businesses that pay taxes are small businesses.  These are in 2018 numbers. source: "https://usafacts.org/data/topics/government-finances/revenue/"
    USA Total revenue/taxes are $4,873 billion (2018).  Corp income taxes are $349 billion (7.2%).
    US Workers pay 88.9% or $4,334 billion from: a) Income tax, b) sales tax, c) Property tax and d) Payroll taxes.
    In 1920, corporations paid most taxes. This has been shifted to citizens by a sell out government. 
    US Tax Revenues: 2019 $3,464 Billion
     From Investors: <<3%   (Federal Capital Gains on Individualss)
     From workers:
        Individual Federal Income Taxes: 50%
        Payroll Taxes: 36% 
  10) To illustrate figuratively to prove the principle of theft.  Let's say workers pay 60% of their income on average. To get to the ethics, it is important to consider a worker making $900k/year from being a worker to with the scale.  Say for example that workers taxes must 20% ethically (to fix 88.9% of total Fed taxes from workers vs < 10.1% from corp and wealthy). Consider there are LAYERs where corps/wealthy don't pay taxes, but that turns around to adding LAYERS of extra taxes on Workers, which brings 20% (ethical level) to 60% (current).
     a) 20% (ethical)->35%. But then Mega corps doing tax evasion (ethically) brings workers from 20%->40%.
     b) 35%->48%: Wealthy paying low capital gains causes workers to pay a new unethical layer of workers-taxes to make up for it.
     c) 48%->50%: Wealthy use Share-buy-back so many years are skipped until capital gains. Paying for Fed gov costs are shifted to workers-taxes.
     d) 48%->50%: Wealthy use off-shore-tax-evansino (Panama Papers, etc.) to skip paying taxes.  Paying for Fed gov costs are shifted to workers-taxes.
     e) 48%->50%: Congress abnormally reduces IRS budget so investigating tax evasion by Wealthy investors goes unfound.  Paying for Fed gov costs are shifted to workers-taxes.
     f) 20% (ethical). But then Mega corps doing tax evasion (ethically) brings workers from 20%->40%.

reasoning_on_size_of_problem:
  - reasoning: |
      We find the best number, between these three numbers:
      A. When US Workers pay 88.9% of US Gov Taxes/Revenues. Compared to capital gains at ~~~~~n%~~~~~  (in 2018). What amount should corporations pay, if the tax burden SHOULD BE shifted from US workers to corporations. What percent of the $4,873 billion (2018) US Gov tax revenues should come from businesses?
      B. Find the quote for the amount of tax evasion by corporations from articles.
      C. Find the profits across all publicly traded companies.
         Find the amount of tax paid by those publicly traded companies.
         Find the amount of tax citizens estimate should be paid on profits (n%). Compare how much was really paid vs the percent from
         profits.
      D. Find the revenue from all publicly traded USA companies.
         Find a percentage of their revenue that should be taxed and find that number.  Compare that to the amount of taxes collected.

            Fortune 500 companies are holding more than $2.6 trillion in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes.
            At least 366 companies, or 73 percent of the Fortune 500, operate one or more subsidiaries in tax haven countries.

            These 366 companies collectively maintain at least 9,755 tax haven subsidiaries. The 30 companies with the most money officially booked offshore for tax purposes collectively operate 2,213 tax haven subsidiaries.
            Four companies (Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and General Electric) account for 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies' offshore cash.

            Thirty Fortune 500 companies account for 68 percent, or $1.76 trillion, of these offshore profits.

            About 57 percent of companies with tax haven subsidiaries have set up at least one in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands — two particularly notorious tax havens. The profits that all American multinationals — not just Fortune 500 companies —implausibly claimed they earned in these two island nations according to the most recent data totaled 1,884 percent and 1,313 percent of each country’s entire yearly economic output, respectively.

            Only 58 Fortune 500 companies disclose what they would expect to pay in U.S. taxes if their profits were not officially booked offshore. In total, these 58 companies would owe $240 billion in additional federal taxes. The average tax rate the 58 companies currently pay to other countries on this income is a mere 6.1 percent, implying that most of it is booked to tax havens.

            Apple holds at least $246 billion offshore, a sum greater than any other company’s offshore cash pile. It owes $76.7 billion in U.S. taxes if these profits were not officially held offshore for tax purposes.  A recent ruling by the European Commission, which is under appeal, found that Apple used this tax haven structure in Ireland to pay a rate of just 0.005 percent on its European profits in 2014, and has required that the company pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland.

        - company: "Citigroup"

          description: |
            The financial services company officially reports $47 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $13.1 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that Citigroup currently has paid only a 7 percent tax rate on its offshore profits to foreign governments, indicating that most of the money is booked in tax havens levying little to no tax. Citigroup maintains 137 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.

          description: |
            The sneaker giant officially holds $12.2 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $4.1 billion in U.S. taxes. This implies Nike has paid a mere 1.4 percent tax rate to foreign governments on those offshore profits, indicating that nearly all of the money is officially held by subsidiaries in tax havens. Nike likely does this by licensing trademarks for its products to subsidiaries in Bermuda and then essentially charging itself royalties to use those trademarks. The shoe company, which operates 1,142 retail stores throughout the world, does not operate one in Bermuda.

        - company: "General Electric"

            General Electric, the nation’s largest corporation, had a very good year in 2010. 

            The company reported worldwide profits of $14.2 billion, and said $5.1 billion of the total came from its operations in the United States. Its American tax bill? None. In fact, G.E. claimed a tax benefit of $3.2 billion.      

            Since 2002, the company has eliminated a fifth of its work force in the United States while increasing overseas employment. In that time, G.E.’s accumulated offshore profits have risen to $92 billion from $15 billion.

            Tech giant Google shifted nearly $23 billion to an offshore tax haven in 2017, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.

            Securities filings with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce show Google funneled $22.7 billion through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in an effort to trim its foreign tax bill. 

            According to Reuters, the company used Google Netherlands Holdings BV to legally shift revenue on royalties earned outside of the U.S. to Google Ireland Holdings – based in Bermuda – where there is no corporate income tax.

      It was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before a United States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of 
      billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel’s chairman called “ghost companies.”

      Five months after Mr. Cook’s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income. 

      Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.

      “Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

    description: |
      On 29 August 2016, after a two-year investigation, Margrethe Vestager of the European Commission announced: "Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple". The Commission ordered Apple to pay €13 billion, plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes from 2004–14 to the Irish state. It was the largest corporate tax fine in history. On 7 September 2016, the Irish State secured a majority in Dáil Éireann to reject payment of the back-taxes, which including penalties could reach €20 billion, or 10% of 2014 Irish GDP. In November 2016, the Irish government formally appealed the ruling, claiming there was no violation of Irish tax law, and that the commission's action was "an intrusion into Irish sovereignty", as national tax policy is excluded from EU treaties. In November 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook, announced Apple would appeal, and in September 2018, Apple lodged €13 billion to an escrow account, pending appeal. In July 2020, the European General Court struck down EU tax decision as illegal, ruling in favor of Apple.

      It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens. The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.

      Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures has helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation.

      The fortunes of the superrich are growing more quickly than the wealth of everyone else, thanks in part to offshore companies the elite use to minimize their taxes. Queen Elizabeth II, Madonna and Bono have all taken advantage of such companies, the documents reveal. Americans are big customers: The hedge fund billionaire James H. Simons and his family were beneficiaries of a massive trust in Bermuda. And Warren A. Stephens, who aggressively grew a family investment bank in Arkansas, used an opaque company to hide his stake in a payday loan business accused of exploiting the poor.

      Big companies have long relied on strategies to reduce their tax bills. But the new tax law is making it even easier, with a new analysis finding that 60 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no taxes on a total of $79 billion of profits earned in 2018.

      The companies, which include tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix, should have paid a collective $16.4 billion in federal income taxes based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's 21 percent corporate tax rate, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Instead, these corporations received a net tax rebate of $4.3 billion. The analysis is based on the corporations' annual financial reports, which were filed earlier this year to report their 2018 results. 

      Defenders of the corporate cuts under the tax law that took effect this year, which lowered the rate companies pay to 21 percent from from 35 percent, contend they will plump profits, drive investment and boost economic growth.

      At least 60 companies reported that their 2018 federal tax rates amounted to effectively zero, or even less than zero, on income earned on U.S. operations, according to an analysis released today by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The number is more than twice as many as ITEP found roughly, per year, on average in an earlier, multi-year analysis before the new tax law went into effect. 

      Among them are household names like technology giant Amazon.com Inc. and entertainment streaming service Netflix Inc., in addition to global oil giant Chevron Corp., pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Co., and farming and commercial equipment manufacturer Deere & Co.

      The identified companies were "able to zero out their federal income taxes on $79 billion in U.S. pretax income," according to the ITEP report, which was released today. "Instead of paying $16.4 billion in taxes, as the new 21 percent corporate tax rate requires, these companies enjoyed a net corporate tax rebate of $4.3 billion, blowing a $20.7 billion hole in the federal budget last year." To compile the list, ITEP analyzed the 2018 financial filings of the country's largest 560 publicly-held companies.

      The Moline, Illinois-based Deere, which was started in 1837 by blacksmith John Deere, who made farming plows, reported earning $2.15 billion in U.S. income before taxes. It owed no U.S. taxes in 2018 and reported that it was owed $268 million from the government, after taking into consideration various deductions and credits, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company reported global profits of $2.37 billion.

    source: "Journalist's Resource, Jan. 14, 2020"
    url: "https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/taxes/tax-evasion-primer/"
    description: |
      U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.

      Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.

      The wealthiest people are among the biggest tax evaders, according to a June 2019 paper in the American Economic Review. The authors — Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman — analyzed 685 records from Norway, Sweden and Denmark exposed following the Panama Papers and Swiss Leaks investigations, along with tax amnesty data from 1,422 households in Norway and 6,811 in Sweden.

      They find the wealthiest 0.01% of asset holders — who own half the wealth in the sample — evade 25% of their tax liability, compared with 5% across the entire sample. Some 35% of the top 0.5% richest households in the distribution engaged in tax evasion. 

      “The most important insight is that government policies have a critical role to play to reduce tax evasion,” the authors write. “Increasing penalties for tax evaders has not proved to be a very practical way to curb tax cheating so far.” 

      Tax evasion is also rampant among the self-employed, according to U.S. government analyses. As the authors of the AEA paper note, the likelihood of self-employment rises as wealth increases. In instances where there is no third-party reporting — like an employer submitting employee wage information to the federal government — the noncompliance rate is 63%, according to IRS research. Misreporting is only at 1% when income amounts are subject to substantial information reporting and withholding. 

      The IRS calls this “visibility.” Income that self-employed people earn is less “visible” than income earned by someone who works for a company or nonprofit, both of which would report wage information to the IRS every year. Business income made up the biggest chunk — $125 billion — of all underreported individual income, according to the Government Accountability Office report.

      Income taxes will contribute $1.932 trillion. Another $1.373 trillion will come from payroll taxes. This includes $1.011 trillion for Social Security, $308 billion for Medicare, and $43 billion for unemployment insurance. Corporate taxes will add another $284 billion. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act cut taxes for corporations much more than it did for individuals. In 2015, corporations paid 11%, and income taxpayers paid 47%. 

      The Federal Reserve, whose revenue comes from a variety of sources, contributes $71 billion. The Fed is the bank for federal government agencies, and it pays interest on the billions of dollars in operating funds depositedd by these agencies. In addition, the Fed owns $4 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities that it acquired through quantitative easing.

      The remainder of federal revenue comes from excise taxes ($87 billion), tariffs on imports ($54 billion), estates taxes ($22 billion), and miscellaneous receipts ($40 billion).

      In 1952, under Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower, corporate income taxes were nearly a third of the federal government’s receipts but had declined to less than 10% by 2012. This is due to a corporate tax code riddled with loopholes, perks and preferences won by corporate lobbyists and backed by millions of dollars of campaign gifts to Members of Congress. 

      As the budget battles in Washington continue, corporations have stepped into the fray with some of the most aggressive lobbying we’ve seen in years – calling for cuts to corporate tax rates, a widening of offshore tax loopholes that already cost the U.S. Treasury $90 billion a year, and cuts to government services and benefits, including Social Security and Medicare. 

      When a product is sold in America, a chunk of the purchase price is sent to the tax haven to pay for use of the patent, and these funds escape U.S. taxes. One of the companies profiled in this report is Microsoft, which sends 47 cents of every U.S. sales dollar to Puerto Rico to pay for patents on discoveries largely made in the United States. Pfizer has turned these tax-avoiding paper transactions into an art form – it sells 40% of its drugs here but hasn’t reported any U.S. profits in five years. Merck and Citigroup also benefit from offshore tax loopholes.

      To Microsoft and its corporate allies, the nature of the audit posed a dire threat. This was not the IRS they knew. This was an agency suddenly committed to fighting and winning. If the aggression went unchecked, it would only encourage the IRS to try these tactics on other corporations.

      “Most people, the 99%, they’re afraid of the IRS,” said an attorney who works on large corporate audits. “The other 1%, they’re not afraid. They make the IRS afraid of them.”

      Microsoft fought back with every tool it could muster. Business organizations, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to tech trade groups, rallied, hiring attorneys to jump into the fray on Microsoft’s side in court and making their case to IRS leadership and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Soon, members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, were decrying the IRS’ tactics and introducing legislation to stop the IRS from ever taking similar steps again.

      A historically large share of the nation’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few. As a result, millions of American families have less wealth, and therefore fewer opportunities, than they otherwise would. Further, since wealthy people are overwhelmingly white, this extreme wealth concentration reinforces barriers that make it harder for people of color to make gains. One way states can build more broadly shared prosperity is by strengthening their taxes on capital gains — the profits an investor realizes when selling an asset that has grown in value, such as shares of stock, mutual funds, real estate, or artwork.

      Capital gains are generated by wealth. Because wealth is highly concentrated, so is capital gains income. About 80 percent of capital gains go to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers; 69 percent go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.

      By our reckoning, the 500 largest US nonfinancial companies have now accumulated around $1 trillion more than their businesses need. The majority of this is held offshore, in non-US overseas subsidiaries, to avoid the incremental US income taxes they would pay if they repatriated the money under current US laws. 

      All this excess cash is not good for the economy, since it isn’t being used productively. It can tempt companies to make acquisitions or other capital investments that could even destroy value. And it also creates distortions in the economy, compelling investors in these companies, in effect, to hold cash positions in their portfolios that they may not want. When investors bought a share of Apple for $156 on May 12 of this year, for example, they were investing $107 in Apple’s operations, and $49 in Apple’s cash. 

      What’s relevant is how much of the cash held by US-based multinationals could easily be repatriated. Our analysis of the balance sheets of the 500 largest US-based nonfinancial companies confirmed that they had a combined market capitalization of $17.9 trillion at the end of 2016 and revenues of $8.9 trillion. Their $1.66 trillion reserves in cash and near-cash investments amounted to around 10 percent of their total market capitalization and nearly 20 percent of their revenues.

      In 2017, companies brought back a total of $155.1 billion in offshore cash, the Commerce Department said. 

      The tax cuts on corporate profits earned offshore — from 35 percent to a one-time rate of 15.5 percent on cash and 8 percent on other assets — encouraged companies to bring it home.

      Corporations have brought back more than $1 trillion of overseas profits to the U.S. since Congress overhauled the international tax system and prodded companies to repatriate offshore funds.

      Investment banks and think tanks have estimated that American corporations held $1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion in offshore cash at the time the law was enacted. Before the overhaul, companies were incentivized to keep profits overseas because they owed a 35% tax when bringing it back and could defer payment by keeping funds offshore. The law set a one-time 15.5% tax rate on cash and 8% on non-cash or illiquid assets. The repatriation figures were included in the quarterly report on the current-account deficit, which narrowed by $1.1 billion to $124.1 billion in the July-to-September period. The gap is considered the broadest measure of international trade because it includes income payments and government transfers.

      A loophole in the new U.S. tax law could allow multinational corporations like Apple Inc to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes on profits stashed overseas, according to experts. 

      By manipulating their foreign cash positions, a determining factor under the new law, a U.S. multinational could potentially save money by shifting profits to the lower rate from the higher one, according to Stephen Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School. The savings could amount to more than $4 billion in Apple’s case alone, he said.

      A new report about Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix—nicknamed the "Silicon Six" by the non-profit Fair Tax Mark—claims a major gap in the taxes they might be expected to owe and how much they actually pay. 

      According to the report, between 2010 and 2019, using legal tax avoidance strategies that have become popular among corporations, the taxes paid collectively by the companies across all global territories in which they operate was $155.3 billion less than what the actual tax rates would have required. When considering not just the cash paid but money put aside for future taxes, the gap was still $100.2 billion

          Corporate tax is imposed in the United States at the federal, most state, and some local levels on the income of entities treated for tax purposes as corporations. Since January 1, 2018, the nominal federal corporate tax rate in the United States of America is a flat 21% due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. State and local taxes and rules vary by jurisdiction, though many are based on federal concepts and definitions. Taxable income may differ from book income both as to timing of income and tax deductions and as to what is taxable. The corporate Alternative Minimum Tax was also eliminated by the 2017 reform, but some states have alternative taxes. Like individuals, corporations must file tax returns every year. They must make quarterly estimated tax payments. Groups of corporations controlled by the same owners may file a consolidated return.

      The U.S. currently has seven federal income tax brackets, with rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%. If you’re one of the lucky few to earn enough to fall into the 37% bracket, that doesn’t mean that the entirety of your taxable income will be subject to a 37% tax. Instead, 37% is your top marginal tax rate.

      With a marginal tax rate, you pay that rate only on the amount of your income that falls into a certain range. To understand how marginal rates work, consider the bottom tax rate of 10%. For single filers, all income between $0 and $9,700 is subject to a 10% tax rate. If you have $9,900 in taxable income, the first $9,700 is subject to the 10% rate and the remaining $200 is subject to the tax rate of the next bracket (12%). Check out the charts below to see what your top marginal tax rate is.

          Personal income is an individual's total earnings from wages, investment interest, and other sources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a median personal income of $865 weekly for all full-time workers in 2017. The U.S. Census Bureau lists the annual median personal income at $33,706 in 2019.

          Income patterns are evident on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity and educational characteristics. In 2005 roughly half of all those with graduate degrees were among the nation's top 15% of income earners. Among different demographics (gender, marital status, ethnicity) for those over the age of 18, median personal income ranged from $3,317 for an unemployed, married Asian American female to $55,935 for a full-time, year-round employed Asian American male. According to the US Census, men tended to have higher income than women, while Asians and Whites earned more than African Americans and Hispanics. 

           Field of study significantly affects earning potential, and the more specific education is disaggregated, the larger the variance. For example, the 2013-15 American Community Survey reported median incomes for workers aged 25-34 ranging from $24,030 for bachelor's degrees in arts and humanities, to $68,143 for bachelor's degrees in engineering. A 2011 report by Georgetown University on full-time, employed earners found that median income for specific majors varied from $29,000 for Counseling Psychology to $120,000 for Petroleum Engineering.

      Individuals, whether they are self-employed or earn a paycheck from a small business or a giant corporation, foot most of the federal government’s bills.

      Of the $3.46 trillion in receipts taken in by the U.S. Treasury during fiscal 2019, nearly half came from the $1.72 trillion in individual income taxes collected. In addition, $1.24 trillion in Social Security and Medicare taxes were paid by individuals, bringing their share to 85%.

      Taxes paid by corporations last year totaled $230 billion, or just 6.6% of the total in 2019. The remainder of federal revenues are made up from customs duties on imported goods, excise taxes such as those on gasoline, estate taxes and other miscellaneous taxes and fees.

      WHO PAYS THE MOST? W2 wage earners - those with a regular paycheck from a business, government entity or non-profit - make up the largest share of tax revenue through income tax and social insurance withholdings, like the payroll tax that funds Social Security, the government retirement program.

      Half of all federal revenue (50 percent) comes from individual income taxes. The income tax is generally progressive: higher-income households generally pay a larger share of their income in income taxes than lower-income households do.

      Another 36 percent of revenue comes from payroll taxes, which are assessed on the wage or salary paychecks of almost all workers and are used to fund Social Security, Medicare Hospital Insurance, and unemployment insurance. By law, employers and employees split the cost of payroll taxes, but research has shown that employers pass their portion of the cost on to workers in the form of lower wages.

      Corporate income taxes make up about 7 percent of federal revenue, with the remaining 8 percent coming from excise taxes, estate taxes, and other revenue sources. Excise taxes are collected on the sale of certain goods (e.g., fuel, alcohol, and tobacco); they are intended to raise revenue and, in some cases, discourage consumption of the taxed product. These made up about 3 percent of federal receipts in 2019.

      The current federal top marginal tax rate on long-term capital gains in the United States is a total of 23.8 percent (20 percent plus a 3.8 percent tax to fund the Affordable Care Act) for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 ($250,000 married filing jointly) or more. In addition, states and some localities levy taxes on capital gains income, which range from zero percent in states with no individual income tax, such as Florida, Texas, South Dakota, and Wyoming, to 13.3 percent in California (See Table 1). An individual who has capital gains income is subject to both federal and state capital gains taxes. Taking into account the federal deductibility of state taxes and the phase-out of itemized deductions, top marginal tax rates on capital gains range from 25 percent in the nine states that do not levy a tax on personal income to 33 percent in California. The average across the United States is 28.6 percent.

      California has the highest state-level sales tax rate, at 7.25 percent. Four states tie for the second highest statewide rate, at 7 percent: Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Tennessee. The lowest non-zero state-level sales tax is in Colorado, which has a rate of 2.9 percent. Five states follow with 4 percent rates: Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, New York, and Wyoming. 

      No state rates have changed since April 2019, when Utah’s state-collected rate increased from 5.95 percent to 6.1 percent. (The state rate is now officially 4.85 percent, but the state collects an additional 1.25 percent in mandatory taxes that are distributed to local governments, in addition to local option taxes imposed by localities).

      The five states with the highest average local sales tax rates are Alabama (5.22 percent), Louisiana (5.07 percent), Colorado (4.75 percent), New York (4.52 percent), and Oklahoma (4.44 percent). Average local rates rose the most in Illinois, changing the state’s combined ranking from 7th highest to 6th highest. Part of this increase can be traced to the city of Evanston, which raised its city tax from 1 percent to 1.25 percent,5 and to Marion City, which raised its sales tax from 8.75 percent to 9.5 percent in an attempt to pay down city-levied property taxes. Louisiana moved from third to second highest when East Baton Rouge increased its parish sales tax by half a percent.7 This new rate kicked in on April 1.8 Meanwhile, a 1 percent increase in Tuscaloosa’s local sales tax helped take Alabama’s combined rank from 5th to 4th. Nevada’s combined ranking moved from 14th to 12th. The biggest driver of this change was a 0.125 percentage-point increase in Clark County, home to Las Vegas.10 Iowa’s rank moved from 29th to 27th largely due to new 1 percent local sales taxes in the cities of Bondurant, Clive, Grimes, Johnston, and Urbandale.
