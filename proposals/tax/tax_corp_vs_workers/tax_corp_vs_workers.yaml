# Citizens are often powerless.  
# The government rarely uses criminal prosecution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

describe_problem_area: |
    When congress wasn't corrupt in 1940, the total US revenue (taxes collected was):
       ~50% from Workers/Tax Payers (~~~1940~~~): Income tax, Payroll Tax, Social Security, sales tax, Property taxes
             $??? Billion (1940) caused n% of all US Tax Revenues
       ~50% from Businesses/corporations (1940): Corporate Income tax  
             $??? Billion (1940) caused n% of all US Tax Revenues
             
    Now that congress sells out the American people and RIGS THE ECONOMY, this shifts costs to workers instead of businesses.
       ~88.9% from Workers/Tax Payers (2017): Income tax, Payroll Tax, Social Security, sales tax, Property tax
             $??? Billion (1940) caused n% of all US Tax Revenues
       ~7.2% from Businesses/corporations (2017): Corporate Income tax  
             $??? Billion (1940) caused n% of all US Tax Revenues
    
    Consider if 1940's was the correct ethical value (without a rigged economy)

reasoning: |
    1) In 1940, the US Gov revenues/taxes came MORE from corporations/businesses than from individual's taxes. SOURCE: https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/individual-income-vs-corporate-income-tax-revenues-ff03042019 .By 2017, Individual Income Taxes generated 800% MORE tax revenues than Corporate Taxes. Worse than that, Individuals pay a range of taxes. 88.9% of US Gov tax revenue/taxes came from US workers/citizens and 7.2% came from corporate/business taxes (2018) Do you consider it THEFT that corporation’s corrupt congress (via billions yearly spent via lobbyists?) to make citizens pay the taxes that corporations should be taxes?
    2) 2018 US Tax Revenues are $4,873 billion. 88.9% by workers and 7.2% by corporations/businesses. You decide what is consider THEFT if/when corporations are not paying the taxes they should because it was shifted to US workers. Decide if and HOW MUCH is stolen by how much corporations should be paying (if individual taxes (88.9%) ethically need to shift back to corporations paying it).  {Needs research and debate}
    3) USA workers/citizens pay 88.9% of US Gov taxes. All corporations and businesses only pay 7.2%.  This is even worse when large corporations are the one that can do tax evasions so the businesses that pay taxes are small businesses. These are in 2018 numbers. Source: https://usafacts.org/data/topics/government-finances/revenue/ USA Total revenue/taxes are $4,873 billion (2018). Corp income taxes are $349 billion (7.2%). US Workers pay 88.9% or $4,334 billion from: a) Income tax, b) sales tax, c) Property tax and, d) Payroll taxes.

reasoning_on_size_of_problem:
    - reasoning: |
        We find the best number, between these three numbers:
        A. When US Workers pay 88.9% of US Gov Taxes/Revenues. Compared to all businesses at 7.2% (in 2018). What amount should corporations pay, if the tax burden SHOULD BE shifted from US workers to corporations. What percent of the $4,873 billion (2018) US Gov tax revenues should come from businesses?
           
    - problem_2018_USA_citizen_taxes: 88.9% @ $4,334 billion (2018)
    - problem_2018_USA_corporate_taxes: 7.2% @ $349 billion (2018)

           key_findings_from_the_above_report: |
              At least 366 companies, or 73 percent of the Fortune 500, operate one or more subsidiaries in tax haven countries.

              These 366 companies collectively maintain at least 9,755 tax haven subsidiaries. The 30 companies with the most money officially booked offshore for tax purposes collectively operate 2,213 tax haven subsidiaries.

              Four companies (Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and General Electric) account for 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies' offshore cash.

              Thirty Fortune 500 companies account for 68 percent, or $1.76 trillion, of these offshore profits.

              About 57 percent of companies with tax haven subsidiaries have set up at least one in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands — two particularly notorious tax havens. The profits that all American multinationals — not just Fortune 500 companies —implausibly claimed they earned in these two island nations according to the most recent data totaled 1,884 percent and 1,313 percent of each country’s entire yearly economic output, respectively.

              Only 58 Fortune 500 companies disclose what they would expect to pay in U.S. taxes if their profits were not officially booked offshore. In total, these 58 companies would owe $240 billion in additional federal taxes. The average tax rate the 58 companies currently pay to other countries on this income is a mere 6.1 percent, implying that most of it is booked to tax havens.

              Apple holds at least $246 billion offshore, a sum greater than any other company’s offshore cash pile. It owes $76.7 billion in U.S. taxes if these profits were not officially held offshore for tax purposes.  A recent ruling by the European Commission, which is under appeal, found that Apple used this tax haven structure in Ireland to pay a rate of just 0.005 percent on its European profits in 2014, and has required that the company pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland.

              The financial services company officially reports $47 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $13.1 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that Citigroup currently has paid only a 7 percent tax rate on its offshore profits to foreign governments, indicating that most of the money is booked in tax havens levying little to no tax. Citigroup maintains 137 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.

              The sneaker giant officially holds $12.2 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $4.1 billion in U.S. taxes. This implies Nike has paid a mere 1.4 percent tax rate to foreign governments on those offshore profits, indicating that nearly all of the money is officially held by subsidiaries in tax havens. Nike likely does this by licensing trademarks for its products to subsidiaries in Bermuda and then essentially charging itself royalties to use those trademarks. The shoe company, which operates 1,142 retail stores throughout the world, does not operate one in Bermuda.

      source: The New York Times, Jesse Drucker and Simon Bowers, November 6, 2017

      description: |
        It was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before a United States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel’s chairman called “ghost companies.”
      
        Five months after Mr. Cook’s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.

        Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.      

        Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company’s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.

        "Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

      description: |
        On 29 August 2016, after a two-year investigation, Margrethe Vestager of the European Commission announced: "Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple". The Commission ordered Apple to pay €13 billion, plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes from 2004–14 to the Irish state. It was the largest corporate tax fine in history. On 7 September 2016, the Irish State secured a majority in Dáil Éireann to reject payment of the back-taxes, which including penalties could reach €20 billion, or 10% of 2014 Irish GDP. In November 2016, the Irish government formally appealed the ruling, claiming there was no violation of Irish tax law, and that the commission's action was "an intrusion into Irish sovereignty", as national tax policy is excluded from EU treaties. In November 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook, announced Apple would appeal, and in September 2018, Apple lodged €13 billion to an escrow account, pending appeal. In July 2020, the European General Court struck down EU tax decision as illegal, ruling in favor of Apple.

      description: |
        It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens. The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.
      
        Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures has helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation.
      
        The fortunes of the superrich are growing more quickly than the wealth of everyone else, thanks in part to offshore companies the elite use to minimize their taxes. Queen Elizabeth II, Madonna and Bono have all taken advantage of such companies, the documents reveal. Americans are big customers: The hedge fund billionaire James H. Simons and his family were beneficiaries of a massive trust in Bermuda. And Warren A. Stephens, who aggressively grew a family investment bank in Arkansas, used an opaque company to hide his stake in a payday loan business accused of exploiting the poor.

      description: |
        Big companies have long relied on strategies to reduce their tax bills. But the new tax law is making it even easier, with a new analysis finding that 60 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no taxes on a total of $79 billion of profits earned in 2018.

        The companies, which include tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix, should have paid a collective $16.4 billion in federal income taxes based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's 21 percent corporate tax rate, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Instead, these corporations received a net tax rebate of $4.3 billion. The analysis is based on the corporations' annual financial reports, which were filed earlier this year to report their 2018 results. 
        
        Defenders of the corporate cuts under the tax law that took effect this year, which lowered the rate companies pay to 21 percent from from 35 percent, contend they will plump profits, drive investment and boost economic growth.

        U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.
        
        Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.
        
        The wealthiest people are among the biggest tax evaders, according to a June 2019 paper in the American Economic Review. The authors — Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman — analyzed 685 records from Norway, Sweden and Denmark exposed following the Panama Papers and Swiss Leaks investigations, along with tax amnesty data from 1,422 households in Norway and 6,811 in Sweden.
        
        They find the wealthiest 0.01% of asset holders — who own half the wealth in the sample — evade 25% of their tax liability, compared with 5% across the entire sample. Some 35% of the top 0.5% richest households in the distribution engaged in tax evasion. “The most important insight is that government policies have a critical role to play to reduce tax evasion,” the authors write. “Increasing penalties for tax evaders has not proved to be a very practical way to curb tax cheating so far.” Tax evasion is also rampant among the self-employed, according to U.S. government analyses. As the authors of the AEA paper note, the likelihood of self-employment rises as wealth increases. In instances where there is no third-party reporting — like an employer submitting employee wage information to the federal government — the noncompliance rate is 63%, according to IRS research. Misreporting is only at 1% when income amounts are subject to substantial information reporting and withholding. The IRS calls this “visibility.” Income that self-employed people earn is less “visible” than income earned by someone who works for a company or nonprofit, both of which would report wage information to the IRS every year. Business income made up the biggest chunk — $125 billion — of all underreported individual income, according to the Government Accountability Office report.

        At least 60 companies reported that their 2018 federal tax rates amounted to effectively zero, or even less than zero, on income earned on U.S. operations, according to an analysis released today by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The number is more than twice as many as ITEP found roughly, per year, on average in an earlier, multi-year analysis before the new tax law went into effect. 

        Among them are household names like technology giant Amazon.com Inc. and entertainment streaming service Netflix Inc., in addition to global oil giant Chevron Corp., pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly & Co., and farming and commercial equipment manufacturer Deere & Co.

        For decades, profitable Fortune 500 companies have manipulated the tax system to avoid paying even a dime in tax on billions of dollars in U.S. profits. This ITEP report provides the first comprehensive look at how corporate tax changes under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affect the scale of corporate tax avoidance. The report finds that in 2018, 60 of America’s biggest corporations zeroed out their federal income taxes on $79 billion in U.S. pretax income. Instead of paying $16.4 billion in taxes at the 21 percent statutory corporate tax rate, these companies enjoyed a net corporate tax rebate of $4.3 billion.

        Complaining that the United States has one of the world’s highest corporate tax levels, President Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly vowed to shrink it.

        Yet if the level is so high, why have so many companies’ income tax bills added up to zero?

        That’s what a new analysis of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies that earned more than $3.8 trillion in profits showed.

        Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them — nearly 40 percent — paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. 

        Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe.

        Under the late Jack Welch, who ran the company from 1981 to 2001, a tiny corporate tax team was transformed into a money-spinning entrepreneurial machine, with 1,200 tax lawyers spanning five continents.

        The fruits: between 2008 and 2015 the company not only paid no federal income tax in the US, according to research by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, it booked positive tax benefits worth more than $1.3bn over the seven-year period.

        Many of the most profitable U.S. corporations paid little or no federal income tax from 2008 to 2012, according to a five-year study issued on Tuesday by a left-leaning tax activist group.

        Citizens for Tax Justice looked at 288 profitable Fortune 500 companies and said that 26 of them - including Boeing Co BA.N, General Electric Co GE.N and Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N - paid no federal income tax in the five-year period.

        The group also said that 111 of the 288 companies paid no federal income tax in at least one of the five years measured.

        "And far too many aren’t paying U.S. taxes at all. Most multinationals are paying lower tax rates here in the United States than they pay on their foreign operations,” he said.

        The new tax law will increase income inequality since it delivers far larger tax cuts to households at the top, measured as a share of income, than to households at the bottom or middle of the income distribution.  In 2025, when the new law will be fully phased in and before many provisions in it are scheduled to expire, it will boost the after-tax incomes of households in the top 1 percent by 2.9 percent, or roughly triple the 1.0 percent gain for households in the bottom 60 percent, according to TPC. Similarly, households in the top one-tenth of 1 percent (0.1 percent) will receive a 2.7 percent increase in after-tax income.

        The average tax cut that year for the top 1 percent — those with incomes above $837,800 — will be $61,100.  Those in the top 0.1 percent — households making more than $4.7 million a year — will receive windfalls averaging $252,300.  In stark contrast, the bottom 60 percent of households — those making under $91,700 — will receive about $400, on average.  Notably, these numbers do not include the negative effects on some middle-income families from the law’s repeal of the ACA’s individual mandate, such as increasing the number of uninsured and raising premiums.

        Cracking: Businesses breaking apart to claim the pass-through business deduction. The lack of clarity or logic in the pass-through deduction regarding which businesses and what income qualifies has opened the door to a great deal of creative thinking about how to fit under its terms. Law professor Samuel Donaldson has referred to two games designed to take advantage of the provision’s ambiguity as cracking and packing.

        With cracking, a business operating as a nonqualifying service business may nevertheless contain components or activities that would qualify for the deduction. By cracking the business into two separate pass-through businesses, business owners can secure the deduction’s benefit for the qualifying portions of the business. An example of this approach would be a big law or lobbying firm splitting off ownership of its office building and associated furniture, gym, and restaurant into a separate pass-through business. The business income from the lawyers’ legal services would not qualify for the pass-through business income deduction, but income earned by the separate business that provides office space, furnishings, a gym, and a restaurant would likely qualify.
