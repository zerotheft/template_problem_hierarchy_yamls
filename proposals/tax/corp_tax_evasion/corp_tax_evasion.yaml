# Citizens are often powerless.
# The government rarely uses criminal prosectution tools (subpoenas, legal discovery, etc.) when the privileged class steals.
# When these tools aren't applied, citizens have no recourse except to approximate what is being stolen.

describe_problem_area: |
  U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.

  Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.

reasoning: |
  1) Are credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations are doing unethical tax evasion (by any term)?:
    And those companies and executives were never convicted of tax evasion related crimes?{You the citizen will vote}
  2) If a US citizen (commoner) works in the USA, lives in the USA but had their paycheck deposited into their off-shore bank.  
    If they then never paid taxes, they would be put in jail.  If US companies do the same (put their profits or revenue offshore) when they are a USA company or the revenue was generated in the USA, does the government chage them with a crime? 
    And convict them? If not, then the government sells out.  {Needs research and debate}
  3) Do you consider it THEFT if corporations do tax evasion by moving profits offshore and not paying taxes? (Especially if citizens are put in jail if they did it with their salarys)
  4) Does the USA put commoners in jail when they do tax evasion: {Needs research and debate}
  5) Are  credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations carry out tricks to move profits or revenue to offshore entities for the purpose of tax evasion? 
  6) Do you consider it a crime of THEFT if corporations carry out tricks to do tax evasion (or instead something you consider on unethically not paying taxes)? Especially if a USA worker would
    go to jail if they did the same with not paying taxes on their salary?
  7) If a USA worker lived in the US, worked in the US, but had a bank account in Irland.  If they had their employer auto-deposite their paycheck to their Iriland bank, they would be put in jail for tax exavsion when they didn't pay taxes. Ethically, this is the tax evasion corporations carry out (after looking past their excuses). The decision for the voter is it theft then corporations do the kind of tax behavior that would send a USA worker to jail if they did it.
  8) USA workers/citizens pay 88.9% of US Gov taxes.  All corporations and businesses only pay 7.2%.  This is even worse when large corporations are the one that can do tax evasions so the businesses that pay taxes are small businesses. These are in 2018 numbers. Source: "https://usafacts.org/data/topics/government-finances/revenue/
    USA Total revenue/taxes are $4,873 billion (2018).  Corp income taxes are $349 billion (7.2%).
    US Workers pay 88.9% or $4,334 billion from: a) Income tax, b) sales tax, c) Property tax and d) Payroll taxes.
    In 1920, corporations paid most taxes. This has been shifted to citizens by a sell out government.
  9) Do USA corporation use subsideary companies in other countries to push their profits overseas so they don't pay zero (or far less) taxes in the USA?
  10) Do USA corporation use subsideary companies, and then have their profits from prior year staying in other countries for later years because they do NOT want to bring it back into the USA (because they probably want to avoid taxes)?

reasoning_on_size_of_problem:
  - reasoning: |
      We find the best number, between these three numbers:
      A. When US Workers pay 88.9% of US Gov Taxes/Revenues. Compared to all businesses
         at 7.2% (in 2018). What amount should corporations pay, if the tax
         burden SHOULD BE shifted from US workers to corporations. What percent
         of the $4,873 billion (2018) US Gov tax revenues should come from businesses?
      B. Find the quote for the amount of tax evasion by corporations
         from articles.
      C. Find the profits across all publicly traded companies.
         Find the amount of tax paid by those publicly traded companies.
         Find the amount of tax citizens estimate should be paid on profits
         (n%).  Compare how much was really paid vs the percent from
         profits.
      D. Find the revenue from all publicly traded USA companies.
         Find a percentage of their revenue that should be taxed
         and find that number.  Compare that to the amount of taxes collected.

          key_findings_from_the_above_report: |
            At least 366 companies, or 73 percent of the Fortune 500, operate one or more subsidiaries in tax haven countries.

            These 366 companies collectively maintain at least 9,755 tax haven subsidiaries. The 30 companies with the most money officially booked offshore for tax purposes collectively operate 2,213 tax haven subsidiaries.

            Four companies (Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and General Electric) account for 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies' offshore cash.

            Thirty Fortune 500 companies account for 68 percent, or $1.76 trillion, of these offshore profits.

            About 57 percent of companies with tax haven subsidiaries have set up at least one in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands — two particularly notorious tax havens. The profits that all American multinationals — not just Fortune 500 companies —implausibly claimed they earned in these two island nations according to the most recent data totaled 1,884 percent and 1,313 percent of each country’s entire yearly economic output, respectively.

            Only 58 Fortune 500 companies disclose what they would expect to pay in U.S. taxes if their profits were not officially booked offshore. In total, these 58 companies would owe $240 billion in additional federal taxes. The average tax rate the 58 companies currently pay to other countries on this income is a mere 6.1 percent, implying that most of it is booked to tax havens.

      Tax dodging by multinational corporations costs the US approximately $111 billion each year.

      From 2008 – 2014 the 50 largest US companies collectively received $27 in federal loans, loan guarantees and bailouts for every $1 they paid in federal taxes. 

      From 2008 – 2014 these 50 companies spent approximately$2.6 billion on lobbying while receiving nearly $11.2 trillion in federal loans, loan guarantees and bailouts. 

      Even as these 50 companies earned nearly $4 trillion in profits globally from 2008 – 2014, they used offshore tax havens to lower their effective overall tax rate to just 26.5%, well below the statutory rate of 35% and even below average levels paid in other developed countries. Only 5 of 50 companies paid the full 35% corporate tax rate

          Apple holds at least $246 billion offshore, a sum greater than any other company’s offshore cash pile. It owes $76.7 billion in U.S. taxes if these profits were not officially held offshore for tax purposes.  A recent ruling by the European Commission, which is under appeal, found that Apple used this tax haven structure in Ireland to pay a rate of just 0.005 percent on its European profits in 2014, and has required that the company pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland.

          The financial services company officially reports $47 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $13.1 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that Citigroup currently has paid only a 7 percent tax rate on its offshore profits to foreign governments, indicating that most of the money is booked in tax havens levying little to no tax. Citigroup maintains 137 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.

          The sneaker giant officially holds $12.2 billion offshore for tax purposes on which it owes $4.1 billion in U.S. taxes. This implies Nike has paid a mere 1.4 percent tax rate to foreign governments on those offshore profits, indicating that nearly all of the money is officially held by subsidiaries in tax havens. Nike likely does this by licensing trademarks for its products to subsidiaries in Bermuda and then essentially charging itself royalties to use those trademarks. The shoe company, which operates 1,142 retail stores throughout the world, does not operate one in Bermuda.

          General Electric, the nation’s largest corporation, had a very good year in 2010. 

          The company reported worldwide profits of $14.2 billion, and said $5.1 billion of the total came from its operations in the United States. Its American tax bill? None. In fact, G.E. claimed a tax benefit of $3.2 billion.      

          Since 2002, the company has eliminated a fifth of its work force in the United States while increasing overseas employment. In that time, G.E.’s accumulated offshore profits have risen to $92 billion from $15 billion.

          Tech giant Google shifted nearly $23 billion to an offshore tax haven in 2017, according to a Reuters report on Thursday.

          Securities filings with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce show Google funneled $22.7 billion through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in an effort to trim its foreign tax bill. 

          According to Reuters, the company used Google Netherlands Holdings BV to legally shift revenue on royalties earned outside of the U.S. to Google Ireland Holdings – based in Bermuda – where there is no corporate income tax.

    source: "The New York Times, November 6, 2017"

    description: |
      It was May 2013, and Mr. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, appeared before a United States Senate investigative subcommittee. After a lengthy inquiry, the committee found that the company had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into Irish subsidiaries that the panel’s chairman called “ghost companies.”

      Five months after Mr. Cook’s testimony, Irish officials began to crack down on the tax structure Apple had exploited. So the iPhone maker went hunting for another place to park its profits, newly leaked records show. With help from law firms that specialize in offshore tax shelters, the company canvassed multiple jurisdictions before settling on the small island of Jersey, which typically does not tax corporate income.

      Apple has accumulated more than $128 billion in profits offshore, and probably much more, that is untaxed by the United States and hardly touched by any other country. Nearly all of that was made over the past decade.      

      Apple, for example, pays taxes at a small fraction of that rate on its offshore profits, according to calculations by The Times based on the company’s securities filings. Apple reports that nearly 70 percent of its worldwide profits are earned offshore.

      "Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

    description: |
      On 29 August 2016, after a two-year investigation, Margrethe Vestager of the European Commission announced: "Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple". The Commission ordered Apple to pay €13 billion, plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes from 2004–14 to the Irish state. It was the largest corporate tax fine in history. On 7 September 2016, the Irish State secured a majority in Dáil Éireann to reject payment of the back-taxes, which including penalties could reach €20 billion, or 10% of 2014 Irish GDP. In November 2016, the Irish government formally appealed the ruling, claiming there was no violation of Irish tax law, and that the commission's action was "an intrusion into Irish sovereignty", as national tax policy is excluded from EU treaties.[8] In November 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook, announced Apple would appeal, and in September 2018, Apple lodged €13 billion to an escrow account, pending appeal. In July 2020, the European General Court struck down EU tax decision as illegal, ruling in favor of Apple.

    description: |
      It’s called the Paradise Papers: the latest in a series of leaks made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shedding light on the trillions of dollars that move through offshore tax havens. The core of the leak, totaling more than 13.4 million documents, focuses on the Bermudan law firm Appleby, a 119-year old company that caters to blue chip corporations and very wealthy people. Appleby helps clients reduce their tax burden; obscure their ownership of assets like companies, private aircraft, real estate and yachts; and set up huge offshore trusts that in some cases hold billions of dollars.

      Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures has helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation.

      The fortunes of the superrich are growing more quickly than the wealth of everyone else, thanks in part to offshore companies the elite use to minimize their taxes. Queen Elizabeth II, Madonna and Bono have all taken advantage of such companies, the documents reveal. Americans are big customers: The hedge fund billionaire James H. Simons and his family were beneficiaries of a massive trust in Bermuda. And Warren A. Stephens, who aggressively grew a family investment bank in Arkansas, used an opaque company to hide his stake in a payday loan business accused of exploiting the poor.

      Big companies have long relied on strategies to reduce their tax bills. But the new tax law is making it even easier, with a new analysis finding that 60 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no taxes on a total of $79 billion of profits earned in 2018.

      The companies, which include tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix, should have paid a collective $16.4 billion in federal income taxes based on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's 21 percent corporate tax rate, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Instead, these corporations received a net tax rebate of $4.3 billion. The analysis is based on the corporations' annual financial reports, which were filed earlier this year to report their 2018 results. 

      Defenders of the corporate cuts under the tax law that took effect this year, which lowered the rate companies pay to 21 percent from from 35 percent, contend they will plump profits, drive investment and boost economic growth.

      At least 60 companies reported that their 2018 federal tax rates amounted to effectively zero, or even less than zero, on income earned on U.S. operations, according to an analysis released today by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The number is more than twice as many as ITEP found roughly, per year, on average in an earlier, multi-year analysis before the new tax law went into effect. 

      Among them are household names like technology giant Amazon.com Inc. and entertainment streaming service Netflix Inc., in addition to global oil giant Chevron Corp., pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly and Co., and farming and commercial equipment manufacturer Deere & Co.

      The identified companies were "able to zero out their federal income taxes on $79 billion in U.S. pretax income," according to the ITEP report, which was released today. "Instead of paying $16.4 billion in taxes, as the new 21 percent corporate tax rate requires, these companies enjoyed a net corporate tax rebate of $4.3 billion, blowing a $20.7 billion hole in the federal budget last year." To compile the list, ITEP analyzed the 2018 financial filings of the country's largest 560 publicly-held companies.

      The Moline, Illinois-based Deere, which was started in 1837 by blacksmith John Deere, who made farming plows, reported earning $2.15 billion in U.S. income before taxes. It owed no U.S. taxes in 2018 and reported that it was owed $268 million from the government, after taking into consideration various deductions and credits, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company reported global profits of $2.37 billion.

    url: "https://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/taxes/tax-evasion-primer/"
    description: |
      U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.

      Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for just about every other government agency.

      The wealthiest people are among the biggest tax evaders, according to a June 2019 paper in the American Economic Review. The authors — Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman — analyzed 685 records from Norway, Sweden and Denmark exposed following the Panama Papers and Swiss Leaks investigations, along with tax amnesty data from 1,422 households in Norway and 6,811 in Sweden.

      They find the wealthiest 0.01% of asset holders — who own half the wealth in the sample — evade 25% of their tax liability, compared with 5% across the entire sample. Some 35% of the top 0.5% richest households in the distribution engaged in tax evasion. 

      “The most important insight is that government policies have a critical role to play to reduce tax evasion,” the authors write. “Increasing penalties for tax evaders has not proved to be a very practical way to curb tax cheating so far.” 

      Tax evasion is also rampant among the self-employed, according to U.S. government analyses. As the authors of the AEA paper note, the likelihood of self-employment rises as wealth increases. In instances where there is no third-party reporting — like an employer submitting employee wage information to the federal government — the noncompliance rate is 63%, according to IRS research. Misreporting is only at 1% when income amounts are subject to substantial information reporting and withholding. 

      The IRS calls this “visibility.” Income that self-employed people earn is less “visible” than income earned by someone who works for a company or nonprofit, both of which would report wage information to the IRS every year. Business income made up the biggest chunk — $125 billion — of all underreported individual income, according to the Government Accountability Office report.

      Income taxes will contribute $1.932 trillion. Another $1.373 trillion will come from payroll taxes. This includes $1.011 trillion for Social Security, $308 billion for Medicare, and $43 billion for unemployment insurance. Corporate taxes will add another $284 billion. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act cut taxes for corporations much more than it did for individuals. In 2015, corporations paid 11%, and income taxpayers paid 47%. 

      The Federal Reserve, whose revenue comes from a variety of sources, contributes $71 billion. The Fed is the bank for federal government agencies, and it pays interest on the billions of dollars in operating funds depositedd by these agencies. In addition, the Fed owns $4 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities that it acquired through quantitative easing.

      The remainder of federal revenue comes from excise taxes ($87 billion), tariffs on imports ($54 billion), estates taxes ($22 billion), and miscellaneous receipts ($40 billion).

      In 1952, under Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower, corporate income taxes were nearly a third of the federal government’s receipts but had declined to less than 10% by 2012. This is due to a corporate tax code riddled with loopholes, perks and preferences won by corporate lobbyists and backed by millions of dollars of campaign gifts to Members of Congress. 

      As the budget battles in Washington continue, corporations have stepped into the fray with some of the most aggressive lobbying we’ve seen in years – calling for cuts to corporate tax rates, a widening of offshore tax loopholes that already cost the U.S. Treasury $90 billion a year, and cuts to government services and benefits, including Social Security and Medicare. 

      When a product is sold in America, a chunk of the purchase price is sent to the tax haven to pay for use of the patent, and these funds escape U.S. taxes. One of the companies profiled in this report is Microsoft, which sends 47 cents of every U.S. sales dollar to Puerto Rico to pay for patents on discoveries largely made in the United States. Pfizer has turned these tax-avoiding paper transactions into an art form – it sells 40% of its drugs here but hasn’t reported any U.S. profits in five years. Merck and Citigroup also benefit from offshore tax loopholes.

Section 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code reads, “Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.”

      Microsoft had shifted at least $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico, where the company’s tax consultants, KPMG, had persuaded the territory’s government to give Microsoft a tax rate of nearly 0%. Microsoft had justified this transfer with a ludicrous-sounding deal: It had sold its most valuable possession — its intellectual property — to an 85-person factory it owned in a small Puerto Rican city. Over years of work, the IRS uncovered evidence that it believed laid the scheme bare. In one document, a Microsoft senior executive celebrated the company’s “pure tax play.” In another, KPMG plotted how to make the company Microsoft created to own the Puerto Rico factory — and a portion of Microsoft’s profits — seem real.

      Microsoft fought back with every tool it could muster. Business organizations, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to tech trade groups, rallied, hiring attorneys to jump into the fray on Microsoft’s side in court and making their case to IRS leadership and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Soon, members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, were decrying the IRS’ tactics and introducing legislation to stop the IRS from ever taking similar steps again.
